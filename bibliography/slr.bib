  abstract = {Global temperatures have increased at a historically unprecedented pace. This paper finds that the negative effect of temperature on output in countries with hot climates runs through reduced investment, depressed labor productivity, poorer human health, and lower agricultural and industrial output. We find that hot low-income countries suffer the largest costs. In a median low-income country, aggregate output is about 2 percent lower and investment is about 10 percent lower seven years after a 1 degree increase in average annual temperature. We also find that economic development, in general, helps to shield countries from temperature shocks, with hot regions in high-income countries on average sustaining less economic damage from rising temperatures than hot regions in low-income countries.},

  abstract = {Background: A number of studies have reported reductions in mortality risk due to heat and cold over time. However, questions remain about the drivers of these adaptation processes to ambient temperatures. We aimed to analyse the demographic and socioeconomic drivers of the downward trends in vulnerability to heat- and cold-related mortality observed in Spain during recent decades (1980–2018). Methods: We collected data on all-cause mortality, temperature and relevant contextual indicators for 48 provinces in mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands between Jan 1, 1980, and Dec 31, 2018. Fourteen contextual indicators were analysed representing ageing, isolation, urbanicity, heating, air conditioning (AC), house antiquity and ownership, education, life expectancy, macroeconomics, socioeconomics, and health investment. The statistical analysis was separately performed for the range of months mostly causing heat- (June-September) and cold- (October-May) related mortality. We first applied a quasi-Poisson generalised linear regression in combination with distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) to estimate province-specific temperature-mortality associations for different periods, and then we fitted univariable and multivariable multilevel spatiotemporal meta-regression models to evaluate the effect modification of the contextual characteristics on heat- and cold-related mortality risks over time. Findings: The average annual mean temperature has risen at an average rate of 0·36 °C per decade in Spain over 1980–2012, although the increase in temperature has been more pronounced in summer (0·40 °C per decade in June-September) than during the rest of the year (0·33 °C per decade). This warming has been observed, however, in parallel with a progressive reduction in the mortality risk associated to both hot and cold temperatures. We found independent associations for AC with heat-related mortality, and heating with cold-related mortality. AC was responsible for about 28·6\% (31·5\%) of the decrease in deaths due to heat (extreme heat) between 1989 and 1993 and 2009–2013, and heating for about 38·3\% (50·8\%) of the reductions in deaths due to cold (extreme cold) temperatures. Ageing (ie, proportion of population over 64 years) attenuated the decrease in cold-related mortality. Interpretation: AC and heating are effective societal adaptive measures to heat and cold temperatures. This evidence holds important implications for climate change health adaptation policies, and for the projections of climate change impacts on human health. © 2023 The Authors},

  abstract = {Background: More frequent and intense exposure to extreme heat conditions poses a serious threat to public health. However, evidence on the association between heat and specific diagnoses of morbidity is still limited. We aimed to comprehensively assess the short-term association between cause-specific hospital admissions and high temperature, including the added effect of temperature variability and heat waves and the effect modification by humidity and air pollution. Methods: We used data on cause-specific hospital admissions, weather (i.e., temperature and relative humidity), and air pollution [i.e., fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5μ⁢m (PM2.5), fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10μ⁢m (PM10), NO2, and ozone (O3)] for 48 provinces in mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2019. The statistical analysis was performed for the summer season (June–September) and consisted of two steps. We first applied quasi-Poisson generalized linear regression models in combination with distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) to estimate province-specific temperature–morbidity associations, which were then pooled through multilevel univariate/multivariate random-effect meta-analysis. Results: High temperature had a generalized impact on cause-specific hospitalizations, while the added effect of temperature variability [i.e., diurnal temperature range (DTR)] and heat waves was limited to a reduced number of diagnoses. The strongest impact of heat was observed for metabolic disorders and obesity [relative risk (RR) = 1.978; 95\% empirical confidence interval (eCI): 1.772, 2.208], followed by renal failure (1.777; 95\% eCI: 1.629, 1.939), urinary tract infection (1.746; 95\% eCI: 1.578, 1.933), sepsis (1.543; 95\% eCI: 1.387, 1.718), urolithiasis (1.490; 95\% eCI: 1.338, 1.658), and poisoning by drugs and nonmedicinal substances (1.470; 95\% eCI: 1.298, 1.665). We also found differences by sex (depending on the diagnosis of hospitalization) and age (very young children and the elderly were more at risk). Humidity played a role in the association of heat with hospitalizations from acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis and diseases of the muscular system and connective tissue, which were higher in dry days. Moreover, heat-related effects were exacerbated on high pollution days for metabolic disorders and obesity (PM2.5) and diabetes (PM10, O3). Discussion: Short-term exposure to heat was found to be associated with new diagnoses (e.g., metabolic diseases and obesity, blood diseases, acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis, muscular and connective tissue diseases, poisoning by drugs and nonmedicinal substances, complications of surgical and medical care, and symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions) and previously identified diagnoses of hospital admissions. The characterization of the vulnerability to heat can help improve clinical and public health practices to reduce the health risks posed by a warming planet. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13254}

  abstract = {Background: Scarcity of data on the health impacts and associated economic costs of heat waves may limit the will to invest in adaptation measures. We assessed the economic impact associated with mortality, morbidity, and loss of well-being during heat waves in France between 2015 and 2019. Methods: Health indicators monitored by the French national heat wave plan were used to estimate excess visits to emergency rooms and outpatient clinics and hospitalizations for heat-related causes. Total excess mortality and years of life loss were considered, as well as the size of the population that experienced restricted activity. A cost-of-illness and willingness-to-pay approach was used to account for associated costs. Results: Between 2015 and 2019, the economic impact of selected health effects of heat waves amounts to €25.5 billion, mainly in mortality (€23.2 billion), minor restricted activity days (€2.3 billion), and morbidity (€0.031 billion). Conclusion: The results highlight a significant economic burden on the French health system and the population. A better understanding of the economic impacts of climate change on health is required to alert decision-makers to the urgency of mitigation and to support concrete adaptation actions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The empirical analysis has revealed three key findings regarding the impact of weather on the stock market's behaviour. First, various forms of extreme weather conditions consistently lead to influence stock behaviour. Second, results provide valuable insights into market behaviour and help investors to make more informed investment decisions. Third, the weather conditions have new information about the climate risk and investors should react to it swiftly in light of our findings. The saliency theory can help reconcile the theoretical conflicts between the real options and risk-shifting theories when it comes to investing in uncertain and extreme climate conditions.},

Policymakers, businesses and organizations leading international negotiations urge the scientific community to provide realistic and accurate assessments of the possible consequences of so called "high end" climate scenarios. This study illustrates a novel procedure to assess the future flood risk in Europe under high levels of warming. It combines ensemble projections of extreme streamflow for the current century based on EURO-CORDEX RCP 8.5 climate scenarios with recent advances in European flood hazard mapping. Further novelties include a threshold-based evaluation of extreme event magnitude and frequency, an alternative method to removing bias in climate projections, the latest pan-European exposure maps, and an improved flood vulnerability estimation.Estimates of population affected and direct flood damages indicate that by the end of the century the socio-economic impact of river floods in Europe is projected to increase by an average 220\% due to climate change only. When coherent socio-economic development pathways are included in the assessment, central estimates of population annually affected by floods range between 500,000 and 640,000 in 2050, and between 540,000 and 950,000 in 2080, as compared to 216,000 in the current climate. A larger range is foreseen in the annual flood damage, currently of 5.3 B€, which is projected to rise at 20-40 B€ in 2050 and 30-100 B€ in 2080, depending on the future economic growth. © 2015 Z.},

This review addresses ways to reconcile terminology differences across fields and provides an overview of state-of-the-art estimation methodologies, global datasets, and key knowledge gaps. Frequently, the evaluation of flood impacts is limited to property and infrastructure damage. What is lost in these analyses is the wide variety of social and business impacts also borne by communities. Full impacts of floods and related disasters also include health, interruption of public services, and foregone production. Overall, this review draws attention to flood costs that have not conventionally been incorporated into disaster risk analysis, and that could enhance decision-making, such as via modeling of potential future damages. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

We found a growing body of literature on the presence of herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market, where there are indications that the main intentions behind crypto investment are mostly affected by social influence or public sentiment; the crypto market is dominated by irrational investors who base their investment decisions on market sentiment; the uncertainty of the fundamentals leads to investors’ dispersed beliefs, which in turn leads to high trading and speculative bubbles. Additionally, we demonstrate some sociodemographic characteristics of crypto investors and some characteristics of the crypto market that affect investors’ behavior, such as market inefficiency. Our study helps researchers and academics, investors, and regulators by providing a structured network analysis for literature strands, with relevant information for future studies on crypto investor behavior. In addition, it shows the most relevant factors that influence the behavior of the crypto market and its investors, providing the basis for better regulation and protection of investors in the cryptocurrency market.},

In vulnerable neighbourhoods, improving energy efficiency and comfort conditions has an important impact on people living conditions. Rehabilitation strategies are usually designed according to standard scenarios, without taking into account variations related to the users or the type of building. Monitoring this type of housing offers valuable information to be able to select the best strategies based on a diagnosis of their real performance. In this paper we present one year data on energy consumption, hygrothermal comfort and CO2 monitored for 22 dwellings in Madrid, located in six different vulnerable locations. In addition to normal periods, the monitoring campaign includes periods of extreme heat and cold, and two exceptional situations, the “Filomena" snowfall and the COVID pandemic period. The results report poor indoor environmental quality in these dwellings, both in the main rooms and in the bedrooms. Also poor building quality is observed. The recorded energy consumption is lower than that given as a reference in the standards or models, at the cost of a worse indoor environment. The analisys supports the importance of retrofit strategies that take into account the composition of the household, such as single-person households or those with children, the higher vulnerability of dwellings with higher demand, the subjective perception and the role of users, and the need to incorporate improvements in indoor air renewal. © 2024 The Authors},

Using information on tariff cuts by commodity from preferential trade agreements signed between 1995 and 2014, we then show that weather shocks that happen during the negotiation period correlate strongly with the size of tariff cuts. When weather shocks increase (decrease) a country's capacity to produce a given crop, its government negotiates a smaller (larger) tariff cut. These results are consistent with a political economy trade model with sector-specific inputs in which the government places more weight on producers relative to consumers in its objective function.

  abstract = {Within Europe, investment funds are more exposed to climate-sensitive economic sectors than banks, insurers, and pension funds. However, few climate-related financial risk assessments of the fund sector have been conducted. We use 8 trillion EUR of fund portfolio holdings to help fill this gap, using the network of portfolio overlaps. Funds with more polluting portfolios (brown funds) invest across more firms than funds with cleaner portfolios (green funds). This apparent diversification hides a concentration risk: brown funds are more closely connected with each other (have more similar portfolios) than green funds, which tend to herd less (have less similar portfolios with each other). This suggests that, in the event of a widespread climate-related financial shock, brown funds will face greater stress levels than green funds. A climate risk scenario exercise confirms this: among total system losses of 443 billion EUR, brown funds' losses are typically between two and three times higher than green funds' losses. Brown funds also have more systemic impact: because they play a more central role in the investment fund network, brown funds contribute twice as much towards system-wide losses as green funds. These findings suggest that, despite the growing attention paid to sustainable investing, systemic vulnerabilities remain and many funds' portfolio diversification approaches do not yet adequately incorporate climate risk. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an evaluation of the global and regional consequences of climate change for heat extremes, water resources, river and coastal flooding, droughts, agriculture and energy use. It presents change in hazard and resource base under different rates of climate change (representative concentration pathways (RCP)), and socio-economic impacts are estimated for each combination of RCP and shared socioeconomic pathway. Uncertainty in the regional pattern of climate change is characterised by CMIP5 climate model projections. The analysis adopts a novel approach using relationships between level of warming and impact to rapidly estimate impacts under any climate forcing. The projections provided here can be used to inform assessments of the implications of climate change. At the global scale all the consequences of climate change considered here are adverse, with large increases under the highest rates of warming. Under the highest forcing the global average annual chance of a major heatwave increases from 5\% now to 97\% in 2100, the average proportion of time in drought increases from 7\% to 27\%, and the average chance of the current 50 year flood increases from 2\% to 7\%. The socio-economic impacts of these climate changes are determined by socio-economic scenario. There is variability in impact across regions, reflecting variability in projected changes in precipitation and temperature. The range in the estimated impacts can be large, due to uncertainty in future emissions and future socio-economic conditions and scientific uncertainty in how climate changes in response to future emissions. For the temperature-based indicators, the largest source of scientific uncertainty is in the estimated magnitude of equilibrium climate sensitivity, but for the indicators determined by precipitation the largest source is in the estimated spatial and seasonal pattern of changes in precipitation. By 2100, the range across socio-economic scenario is often greater than the range across the forcing levels.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a simple two-step estimation method (Climate Adaptive Response Estimation - CARE) to estimate sectoral climate damage functions, which account for long-run adaptation. The paper applies this method in the context of residential electricity and natural gas demand for the world’s fifth largest economy — California. The advantage of the proposed method is that it only requires detailed information on intensive margin behavior, yet does not require explicit knowledge of the extensive margin response (e.g., technology adoption). Using almost two billion energy bills, we estimate spatially highly disaggregated intensive margin temperature response functions using daily variation in weather. In a second step, we explain variation in the slopes of the dose response functions across space as a function of summer climate. Using 18 climate models, we simulate future demand by letting households vary consumption along the intensive and extensive margins. We show that failing to account for extensive margin adjustment in electricity demand leads to a significant underestimate of the future impacts on electricity consumption. We further show that reductions in natural gas demand more than offset any climate-driven increases in electricity consumption in this context.},

(2014) Understanding the Social Cost of Carbon: A Technical Assessment]. The empirical literature has shown significant increases in climate-driven impacts on overall consumption, yet has not focused on the cost implications of the increased intensity and frequency of extreme events driving peak demand, which is the highest load observed in a period. We use comprehensive, high-frequency data at the level of load balancing authorities to parameterize the relationship between average or peak electricity demand and temperature for a major economy. Using statistical models, we analyze multiyear data from 166 load balancing authorities in the United States. We couple the estimated temperature response functions for total daily consumption and daily peak load with 18 downscaled global climate models (GCMs) to simulate climate change-driven impacts on both outcomes. We show moderate and heterogeneous changes in consumption, with an average increase of 2.8\% by end of century. The results of our peak load simulations, however, suggest significant increases in the intensity and frequency of peak events throughout the United States, assuming today’s technology and electricity market fundamentals. As the electricity grid is built to endure maximum load, our findings have significant implications for the construction of costly peak generating capacity, suggesting additional peak capacity costs of up to 180 billion dollars by the end of the century under business-as-usual.}

  abstract = {Climate scientists have spent billions of dollars and eons of supercomputer time studying how increased concentrations of greenhouse gases and changes in the reflectivity of the earth's surface affect dimensions of the climate system relevant to human society: surface temperature, precipitation, humidity, and sea levels. Recent incarnations of physical climate models have become  sophisticated enough to be able to simulate intensities and frequencies of some extreme events, like tropical storms, under different warming scenarios. In a stark juxtaposition, the efforts  involved in and the public resources targeted at understanding how these physical changes translate into economic impacts are disproportionately smaller, with most of the major models being  developed and maintained with little to no public funding support. The goal of this paper is first to shed light on how (mostly) economists have gone about calculating the "social cost of carbon"  for regulatory purposes and to provide an overview of the past and currently used estimates. In the second part, I will focus on where empirical economists may have the highest value added in  this enterprise: specifically, the calibration and estimation of economic damage functions, which map weather patterns transformed by climate change into economic benefits and damages. A  broad variety of econometric methods have recently been used to parameterize the dose (climate) response (economic outcome) functions. The paper seeks to provide an accessible and  comprehensive overview of how economists think about parameterizing damage functions and quantifying the economic damages of climate change.},

We analyzed the Eurostat mortality database, which includes 45,184,044 counts of death from 823 contiguous regions in 35 European countries, representing the whole population of over 543 million people. We estimated 61,672 (95\% confidence interval (CI)\,=\,37,643–86,807) heat-related deaths in Europe between 30 May and 4 September 2022. Italy (18,010 deaths; 95\% CI\,=\,13,793–22,225), Spain (11,324; 95\% CI\,=\,7,908–14,880) and Germany (8,173; 95\% CI\,=\,5,374–11,018) had the highest summer heat-related mortality numbers, while Italy (295 deaths per million, 95\% CI\,=\,226–364), Greece (280, 95\% CI\,=\,201–355), Spain (237, 95\% CI\,=\,166–312) and Portugal (211, 95\% CI\,=\,162–255) had the highest heat-related mortality rates.

Scientific literature showed a decrease in the level of tyre/road noise generated as temperature increases, but usually under standardised traffic conditions in non-urban environments. Based on a wide network for the hourly monitoring of road traffic flow, air temperature and noise levels across the city of Madrid (Spain), this work proposes and applies a new experimental methodology for studying the dependence of urban road traffic noise on temperature. This study was conducted under real-world traffic conditions involving a wide variability in urban configurations and in the type and state of preservation of vehicles, tires and pavements. From the analysis of data for a whole year, a time interval was identified (from Tuesday to Thursday and between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.) in which the variability in road traffic flow for the whole city of Madrid was stable enough to allow for a linear regression study between temperature and noise levels from urban road traffic. The relationships found were highly significant (p ≤ 0.001) for data from all the noise monitoring stations, with values of higher than 20\% and up to 42\% for the explanation of the variability in the measured noise levels by temperature at most of the measurement points. The values of the slope coefficients at the noise monitoring stations ranged from −0.036 to −0.125 dB/°C, with an average value of −0.090 ± 0.011 dB/°C. These results are within the range of values reported in the scientific literature for experimental tests conducted under conditions of controlled or free-flowing traffic. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This article analyzes whether there is still a significant upward trend once insured natural disaster loss has been normalized. By scaling up loss from past disasters, normalization adjusts for the fact that a hazard event of equal strength will typically cause more damage nowadays than in past years because of wealth accumulation over time. A trend analysis of normalized insured damage from natural disasters is not only of interest to the insurance industry, but can potentially be useful for attempts at detecting whether there has been an increase in the frequency and/or intensity of natural hazards, whether caused by natural climate variability or anthropogenic climate change. We analyze trends at the global level over the period 1990 to 2008, over the period 1980 to 2008 for West Germany and 1973 to 2008 for the United States. We find no significant trends at the global level, but we detect statistically significant upward trends in normalized insured losses from all non-geophysical disasters as well as from certain specific disaster types in the United States and West Germany. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.}

The more weight placed on domestic profits, the more likely it is that the policy maker will respond to a rainfall shortage by reducing import tariffs. These findings are robust to alternative assumptions about market structure and the timing of the game. Using detailed panel data on applied tariffs and rainfall for 70 nations, we find robust evidence that rainfall shortages generally induce policy makers to set lower tariffs on agricultural imports.},

Climate change can affect the macroeconomy both through gradual warming and the associated climate changes (e.g. total seasonal rainfall and sea level increases) and through increased frequency, severity and correlation of extreme weather events (physical risks). Inflationary pressures might arise from a decline in the national and international supply of commodities or from productivity shocks caused by weather-related events such as droughts, floods, storms and sea level rises. These events can potentially result in large financial losses, lower wealth and lower GDP. An abrupt tightening of carbon emission policies could also lead to a negative macroeconomic supply shock (transition risks). This chapter reviews the channels through which climate risks can affect central banks’ monetary policy objectives, and possible policy responses.

Using the MATRIX model, a multi-sector and multi-agent macroeconomic model, we simulate various climate scenarios by employing different carbon cycle models, damage functions, and marginal abatement curves found in the literature. We find that heterogeneous climate damages amplify both the magnitude and the volatility of GDP losses associated with global warming. By the end of the century, we estimate that assuming homogeneous shocks may underestimate the effects of climate change on aggregate output by up to one-third. Moreover, we find that the speed and feasibility of a low-carbon transition crucially depend on (i) the ambition in emission reduction targets set by the policymaker, which determine the level of a carbon tax, and (ii) the rate of technological progress, which influences the shape of the abatement cost curve. © 2024 The Author(s)},

We also analyse the heterogeneous effects of inflation on different product categories. Our results suggest that weather-related disasters have a positive, non-persistent effect on inflation. This reflects the prevalence of negative supply shock channels and positive demand shock channels over negative demand shock channels. We also find that weather-related disasters have more pronounced effects on the inflation of product categories that represent a higher proportion of the spending of low-income households, implying that disasters reinforce inflation inequality. Overall, our results suggest that, as the climate crisis deepens, it might become increasingly challenging for the European Central Bank to control inflation and its inequality effects.},

  abstract = {This article reports the findings of a scoping review assessing the extent and ways in which migrants have been included in health impact assessments (HIAs) and HIA evaluations worldwide. A total of 117 HIAs and two HIA evaluations were included. Only 14\% of hand-searched HIAs mentioned migrants, 5\% analysed migrants and only 2\% included them in their recommendations. Nonetheless, migrants would be expected to be part of the analysis based on the reasons for which migrants were most commonly mentioned. Although the majority of HIAs included in the review mentioned migrants in baseline conditions and impact analysis steps, migrants were seldom included in recommendations. Furthermore, the use of frameworks or tools guiding the completion of an HIA was negatively associated with the inclusion of migrants in recommendations. This is a pivotal risk of frameworks not mentioning migrants. Although workshops and stakeholder engagement were a frequent way of including migrants in HIAs, this usually involved organizations representing migrants, and only seldom included members of the migrant community themselves. The main barriers to including migrants in the HIA impact analysis were the lack of available data on migrants and the significant additional resources required to gather and analyse additional data on migrants. Guidance is needed on ways to optimally include migrants in HIAs and ensure that recommendations for mitigation measures are optimal.},

  abstract = {While climate change impacts on human life have well defined and different origins, the interactions among the diverse impacts are not yet fully understood. Their final effects, however, especially those involving social-economic responses, are likely to play an important role. This paper is one of the first attempts to disentangle and highlight the role of these interactions. It focuses on the economic assessment of two specific climate change impacts: sea-level rise and changes in tourism flows. By using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model the two impacts categories are first analysed separately and then jointly. Considered separately, in 2050, the forecasted 25 cm. of sea level rise imply a GDP loss ranging from (-) 0.1\% in South East Asia to almost no loss in Canada, while redistribution of tourism flows - which in terms of arrivals favours Western Europe, Japan, Korea and Canada and penalises all the other world regions - triggers GDP losses ranging from (-) 0.5\% in Small Island States to (-) 0.0004\% in Canada. GDP gainers are Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Middle East and South Asia. The impact of sea level rise and tourism were simulated jointly and the results compared with those of the two disjoint simulations. From a qualitative point of view, the joint effects are similar to the outcomes of the disjoint exercises; from a quantitative perspective, however, impact interaction does play a significant role. In six cases out of 16 there is a detectable (higher than 2\% and peaking to 70\%) difference between the sum of the outcomes in the disjoint simulation and the outcomes of the joint simulations. Moreover, the relative contribution of each single impact category has been disentangled from the final result. In the case under scrutiny, demand shocks induced by changes in tourism flows outweigh the supply-side shock induced by the loss of coastal land. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The empirical estimation uses a new data set of hourly data on both market variables and temperature variables. There is a vast body of literature on the effect of temperature on final consumers and on wholesale electricity market equilibrium. However, the influence of temperature on the behavior of the wholesale electricity market has not been studied at the hourly level. A new econometric estimation shows some evidence of different effects of temperature and provides a more accurate estimation of the hourly prices. Forecasting out-of-sample performance of the model is satisfactory. The present results have welfare-improving policy implications, because appropriate policy strategies can help public decision-makers promote regulation, such as issuing public weather alert and designing contingent plans to face extreme weather conditions, which improves production efficiency, network management, and consumer saving behavior, taking specific weather conditions into account.},

For instance, we find a small but statistically significant reduction in average sleep duration of 2.8\% (12 min and 8 s) on a tropical night (when daily minimum temperature exceeds 20 °C) compared to a mid-temperature night. We document corresponding changes in physical activity (number of daily steps) and vital signs (resting heart rate) at high minimum temperatures, which could represent potential mechanisms for the link between temperature and sleep.},

  abstract = {There is growing international concern at the rise in the severity of impact and frequency of extreme environmental events, potentially as a manifestation of global environmental change. There is a widely held belief that this trend could be linked with a future rise in the migration or displacement of human populations. However, recent approaches to migration influenced by environmental change call into question the notion that migration can be ascribed in a singular way to particular environmental causes or events. This paper undertakes a systematic review of evidence on population movements associated with weather-related extreme events. The paper demonstrates that in the face of extreme environmental events, it is important to distinguish between three outcomes – migration, displacement, and immobility – each of which interact and respond to multiple drivers. It also proposes a further insight: that both those who move, and those who do not move, may find themselves trapped and vulnerable in the face of such extreme events. A review of evidence suggests that short-term displacement that goes hand-in-hand with loss of life, destruction of property and economic disruption poses significant risks not because it is environmental migration, but because it represents a failure of adaptation to environmental change.},

As a test, this paper used correlation and regression analyses to investigate rainfall intensity as a factor affecting flood damage. For a time period of 15 years, the relationship between insurance losses caused by floods and rainfall intensity data from rain gauges was examined in two Swedish cities. Another objective was to find an approach for damage functions based on rainfall intensity as explanatory variable. Using linear regression, two approaches with considerable high degrees of explanation were found–one based on an exponential function and one on a power function. Using a lower limit for rainfall intensity, the approaches reached degrees of explanation between 30 and 78\%. From this study it was concluded that rainfall intensity during the summer months and the occurrence of insurance damages per day caused by floods were correlated and further that rainfall intensity has a great potential to explain urban flood damages. In the future, additional studies are needed to validate the proposed methods and integrate other flood damage affecting factors in the approach.},

We identify numerous non-catastrophic disasters, thereby improving coverage wrt. the existing literature. Counting residents of cities stricken by a disaster, we find that in the long run, there were 22 residents affected every month per thousand population. This risk factor has been falling by 5 fewer people with every passing decade. France has thus improved its preparedness to natural disasters even though the seaboard regions fare worse than the northern region, most likely because of heightened urban pressure in hazardous areas by the seaside. Tropical territories are more at risk than the temperate European mainland, from a different mix of events. The full economic cost of natural disasters is estimated at 22 € per capita per year and represent a small fraction of property insurance premiums. Residents from safer areas currently subsidize those living in riskier areas. To be more effective, preventive investments should be directed towards the main cities.},

  abstract = {‘Urban greening’ has been proposed as one approach to mitigate the human health consequences of increased temperatures resulting from climate change. We used systematic review methodology to evaluate available evidence on whether greening interventions, such as tree planting or the creation of parks or green roofs, affect the air temperature of an urban area. Most studies investigated the air temperature within parks and beneath trees and are broadly supportive that green sites can be cooler than non-green sites. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data on the cooling effect of parks and results show that, on average, a park was 0.94°C cooler in the day. Studies on multiple parks suggest that larger parks and those with trees could be cooler during the day. However, evidence for the cooling effect of green space is mostly based on observational studies of small numbers of green sites. The impact of specific greening interventions on the wider urban area, and whether the effects are due to greening alone, has yet to be demonstrated. The current evidence base does not allow specific recommendations to be made on how best to incorporate greening into an urban area. Further empirical research is necessary in order to efficiently guide the design and planning of urban green space, and specifically to investigate the importance of the abundance, distribution and type of greening. Any urban greening programme implemented would need to be appropriately designed and monitored to continue to evaluate benefit to human health through reducing temperature.},

  abstract = {The Thirty Years' War, which took place from 1618 to 1648 CE, was an armed military conflict in Europe. It resulted from the culmination of theological differences between advocates of the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, as well as a power struggle for European political hegemony. This war brought about extensive devastation to Europe. Based on documentary evidence, this paper characterizes the climate, weather extremes, and economic and socio-political events in central Europe during that time. Natural climate forcing indicates a gradual climate deterioration during the first half of the 17th century, associated with a decrease in solar activity towards the Maunder Minimum and increased volcanic activity. The mean temperatures in central Europe from 1618 to 1648 were significantly colder than the reference period of 1961 to 1990 in winter, autumn, and annually, while precipitation and drought means did not differ significantly from the reference period. Summer temperatures, spring precipitation, and drought also exhibited significantly greater variability. As for weather extremes, particularly late winter, late spring and early autumn frosts, floods, intense rain spells, and droughts affected grain, fruit, and vine grape harvests, as well as the yields of other crops. These weather extremes contributed to various human impacts, such as food shortages (reflecting harvests and grain prices), famines, and epidemics. Ultimately, these events, along with the effects of the war, led to a decline in the population. The results obtained are discussed within the broader European context, taking into account climate, weather extremes, and socio-economic impacts. © Copyright:},

  abstract = {The global literature on drought and health highlights a variety of health effects for people in developing countries where certain prevailing social, economic and environmental conditions increase their vulnerability especially with climate change. Despite increased focus on climate change, relatively less is known about the health-drought impacts in the developed country context. In the UK, where climate change–related risk of water shortages has been identified as a key area for action, there is need for better understanding of drought-health linkages. This paper assesses people’s narratives of drought on health and well-being in the UK using a source-receptor-impact framing. Stakeholder narratives indicate that drought can present perceived health and well-being effects through reduced water quantity, water quality, compromised hygiene and sanitation, food security, and air quality. Heatwave associated with drought was also identified as a source of health effects through heat and wildfire, and drought-related vectors. Drought was viewed as potentially attributing both negative and positive effects for physical and mental health, with emphasis on mental health. Health impacts were often complex and cross-sectoral in nature indicating the need for a management approach across several sectors that targets drought and health in risk assessment and adaptation planning processes. Two recurring themes in the UK narratives were the health consequences of drought for ‘at-risk’ groups and the need to target them, and that drought in a changing climate presented potential health implications for at-risk groups.},

  abstract = {The objective of our study is to predict the financial losses that may result from natural disasters, along with their level of volatility, over a period of 1 to 15 years. Volatility can lead to significant fluctuations in Profit and Loss (P\&L) for companies that are affected by unexpected events. To achieve this goal, we created a novel two-factor square-root model that allows us to establish a correlation between the frequency of occurrences and volatility, using correlated Brownian motions. Moreover, we utilized a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) to estimate the maximum potential loss in terms of Value at Risk (VaR) for each specific type of natural disaster. To ensure the reliability of our predictions, we compared our results to those of four reference models and conducted a backtesting analysis. This approach is particularly suitable for insurance companies seeking to maintain stable reserves, but it can also be adapted for any other type of business that is vulnerable to extreme events and aims to safeguard a consistent cash flow for their stakeholders.},

School bus electrification efforts are in the early stages in high-income countries, with various funding programs and initiatives targeting the adoption of electric buses. As these new buses hit the roads, it is imperative that their effectiveness in reducing air pollution exposure be evaluated. This review is the first of its kind, analyzing recent case studies of early electric school bus adoption, assessing the air pollution, climate, and health benefits of converting to electric school buses, and exploring the current state of the literature on this topic. Following PRISMA guidelines, our search strategy yielded 167 studies, of which 13 met our selection criteria and were considered for the final analysis. This review establishes that emission reductions, potential health benefits, and economic savings are possible when electric school buses are adopted compared to diesel school buses. We have highlighted the importance of external funding programs, and the logistical and mechanical challenges. The geographical disparities highlight the need for electrification efforts that target marginalized and low-income communities. Significant knowledge gaps remain regarding children's health outcomes and exposure to in-cabin air pollutant levels after electrification. Case studies outside North America are lacking, and are crucial to inform policy and guide future funding efforts. We have provided a crucial analysis of current literature and produced an overview of the essential knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in future research.},

Accounting for the effects of changing temperatures, sea levels, and the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, we model the impact of climate change on productivity and utility in a dynamic general equilibrium framework. By endogenizing people’s migration decisions across millions of \$5 \textbackslash times 5\$ km spatial cells, our approach sheds light on the magnitude and dyadic, education-specific structure of human migration induced by global warming. We find that climate change strongly intensifies global inequality and poverty, reinforces urbanization, and boosts migration from low- to high-latitude areas. Median projections suggest that climate change will induce a voluntary and a forced permanent relocation of 62 million working-age individuals over the course of the 21st century. Overall, under current international migration laws and policies, only a small fraction of people suffering from the negative effects of climate change manages to move beyond their homelands. We conclude that it is unlikely that climate shocks will induce massive international flows of migrants, except under combined extremely pessimistic climate scenarios and highly permissive migration policies. In contrast, poverty resulting from climate change is a real threat to all of us.}

Achieving climate change mitigation targets, such as those proposed in the Paris Agreement, requires emission reductions from this sector. The body of research on technical solutions to cement and concrete decarbonization is wide, but technical measures must be coupled with effective policy to achieve decarbonization. This study undertakes a review of previous research on cement and concrete decarbonization and analyzes the most common proposed measures along their level of action, involved stakeholders, barriers to implementation, and coordinated policy actions. The review yielded 37 studies from peer-reviewed articles and technical reports. Analysis showed consensus on the primary technical measures to decarbonize. For cement production, measures include (I) improved energy efficiency, (II) fuel switching, (III) carbon capture utilization and storage, and (IV) reduction of the clinker-to-cement ratio. For concrete production and its end-uses common proposed measures include (V) alternative binders, (VI) material and construction efficiency and (VII) CO2 uptake by concrete. While the literature shows an emerging consensus around technical solutions for decarbonization, there was less clarity about preferred policy solutions and key barriers. The reviewed studies consistently focused on technical solutions and roadmaps to achieve decarbonization, but often omitted discussion of barriers to implementation or specific policy actions to overcome them. Further research is needed to consider the feasibility and costs of implementation; identify potential points of entry for policy actions at different jurisdictional scales; and identify enforcement needs.},

This study aims to analyze the heatwave vulnerability of the 23 districts of the Hungarian capital, Budapest, by applying a weighted indicator method. For this purpose, 12 indicators were collected, normalized, and finally categorized to reveal spatial heterogeneity through the selected administration units. Socio-economic variables and remote sensing data have also been involved in the study in order to point out as many aspects as possible. Generally, downtown districts have medium vulnerability due to their increased land surface temperature, higher population density and low yearly income per capita. In the case of both Pest-, and Buda-side outer districts, higher NDVI values pose them at the top of the ranking. At the same time, considerable differences can be found regarding other sensitivity and adaptive capacity values. The high ratio of elderly people with cardiovascular disease and the low number of pharmacies per 1000 people were identified as common weak points in the case of almost every district. The revealed weak points may contribute to defining those aspects where urgent and targeted adaptation actions are needed. © 2022 The Author},

We find a positive and statistically significant relationship between temperature and international outmigration only in the most agriculture-dependent countries, consistent with the widely documented adverse impact of temperature on agricultural productivity. Further, the temperature–migration relationship is nonlinear and resembles the nonlinear temperature–yield relationship. In addition, migration flows to current major destinations are especially temperature-sensitive. Policies to address issues related to climate-induced international migration would be more efficient if focused on the agriculture-dependent countries and especially people in those countries whose livelihoods depend on agriculture.},

An accurate spatial representation of tourism can provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of tourism vulnerabilities and exposure, allowing policymakers to make informed decisions and develop effective strategies for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation policies. Here, we stress the need for and propose a first prototype of an open-access spatially-explicit gridded database based on social media data for over 150 different tourism-related classes that depicts tourism density (supply and demand) and perceived satisfaction in Europe. We showcase the potential benefits of such database by mapping the exposure of specific tourism sectors to a range of weather extremes, including floods, windstorms, and heat stress. Based on these results, we argue that a homogeneous spatially-explicit database of tourism is essential to support efficient investments in preparedness and disaster resilience. © 2024 The Author(s).

Climate change impacts are regressive, adding to the already regressive effects of a carbon tax. Wealthy households reduce expenditure on gas and petroleum fuels the most, whereas households in the lowest deciles increase electricity expenditure relatively more. Climate and policy impacts differ significantly also within income groups, reflecting regional variations in the size of climate shocks, the prevalent climate conditions, and the energy mix.

We first present the theoretical links between asset pricing and climate-related risks and develop a theory of how climate risk drivers transmit costs to firms and lead to asset price changes. We then discuss studies looking at past climate-related events, which show that both climate physical impacts and transition dynamics can trigger a revaluation of financial assets through multiple direct and indirect channels. Finally, we review the emerging literature that uses forward-looking methodologies to estimate future climate-related asset price changes, which suggests that climate financial risks can indeed have significant implications on financial stability.},

Welfare gains to countries that self-finance investments in resilient public infrastructure are found to be small, and international aid has to be sizable to achieve significant welfare gains.

A multidisciplinary renaissance of quantitative empirical research is illuminating important linkages in the coupled climate-human system. We highlight key methodological innovations and results describing effects of climate on health, economics, conflict, migration, and demographics. Because of persistent “adaptation gaps,” current climate conditions continue to play a substantial role in shaping modern society, and future climate changes will likely have additional impact. For example, we compute that temperature depresses current U.S. maize yields by \textasciitilde 48\%, warming since 1980 elevated conflict risk in Africa by \textasciitilde 11\%, and future warming may slow global economic growth rates by \textasciitilde 0.28 percentage points per year. In general, we estimate that the economic and social burden of current climates tends to be comparable in magnitude to the additional projected impact caused by future anthropogenic climate changes. Overall, findings from this literature point to climate as an important influence on the historical evolution of the global economy, they should inform how we respond to modern climatic conditions, and they can guide how we predict the consequences of future climate changes.}

Such a threshold definition, which took into account population features such as socio-economic and demographic characteristics, made it possible for a specific threshold temperature to be obtained for each of Spain's 52 provincial capitals in this study. Using generalised linear models with the Poisson regression link, and controlling for trend, autocorrelations and seasonalities of the series, and influenza epidemics, we obtained the impact of low temperatures on mortality in each provincial capital by calculating the relative risks (RRs) and attributable risks (ARs) for natural as well as circulatory and respiratory causes. The study showed higher minimum temperature thresholds in coastal areas, and an overall impact of cold on mortality in Spain due to natural causes RR = 1.13 (95\% CI: 1.11-1.16), circulatory causes RR = 1.18 (95\% CI: 1.15-1.22) and respiratory causes RR = 1.24 (95\% CI: 1.20-1.29) slightly greater than that obtained to date for heat. From a public health standpoint, there is a need for specific cold wave prevention plans at a regional level which would enable mortality attributable to low temperatures to be reduced. These plans have shown themselves to be effective in decreasing heat-related mortality, and we feel that they are essential for reducing cold-related effects on morbidity and mortality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

This lower degree of attention may perhaps be due to the fact that its influence on mortality is less pronounced and longer-term, and that there are other concomitant infectious winters factors. In a climate-change scenario, the studies undertaken to date report differing results. The aim of this study was to analyse mortality attributable to both thermal extremes in Spain's 52 provinces across the period 2000-2009, and estimate the related economic cost to show the benefit or "profitability" of implementing prevention plans against LTD. Methods: Previous studies enabled us: to obtain the maximum daily temperature above which HTD occurred and the minimum daily temperature below which LTD occurred in the 52 provincial capitals analysed across the same study period; and to calculate the relative and attributable risks (\%) associated with daily mortality in each capital. These measures of association were then used to make different calculations to obtain the daily mean mortality attributable to both thermal extremes. To this end, we obtained a summary of the number of degrees whereby the temperature exceeded (excess °C) or fell short (deficit °C) of the threshold temperature for each capital, and calculated the respective number of extreme temperatures days. The economic estimates rated the prevention plans as being 68\% effective. Results: Over the period considered, the number of HTD (4373) was higher than the number of LTD (3006) for Spain as a whole. Notwithstanding this, in every provincial capital the mean daily mortality attributable to heat was lower (3 deaths/day) than that attributable to cold (3.48 deaths/day). In terms of the economic impact of the activation of prevention plans against LTD, these could be assumed to avoid 2.37 deaths on each LTD, which translated as a saving of €0.29M. Similarly, in the case of heat, 2.04 deaths could be assumed to be avoided each day on which the prevention plan against HTD was activated, amounting to a saving of €0.25M. While the economic cost of cold-related mortality across the ten-year period 2000-2009 was €871.7M, that attributable to heat could be put at €1093.2M. Conclusion: The effect of extreme temperatures on daily mortality was similar across the study period for Spain overall. The lower number of days with LTD meant, however, that daily cold-related mortality was higher than daily heat-related mortality, thereby making prevention plans against LTD more "profitable" prevention plans against HTD in terms of avoidable mortality. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

This framework comprises 21 country/region-specific models, estimated over the period 1979Q2 to 2013Q1, and accounts for not only direct exposures of countries to El Niño shocks but also indirect effects through third-markets. We contribute to the climate–macroeconomy literature by exploiting exogenous variation in El Niño weather events over time, and their impact on different regions cross-sectionally, to causatively identify the effects of El Niño shocks (direct and total) on growth, inflation, energy and non-fuel commodity prices. The results show that there are considerable heterogeneities in the responses of different countries to El Niño shocks. While Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa face a short-lived fall in economic activity in response to an El Niño shock, for other countries (including the United States and European region), an El Niño occurrence has a growth-enhancing effect.

  abstract = {Water saving in crop production under climate and environmental changing conditions represents a critical issue for agricultural economy and sustainability. This study develops a novel approach to measure the impact of climate variability on crop water requirement at regional level. Firstly, a model where crop water requirement is the dependent variable and some climate variables are the covariates is estimated by using geographically weighted regression to consider different spatial characteristics of the regions. Then, local regression results are integrated to develop two composite indicators able to highlight critical areas in terms of water requirement and to support local policies and practices. The empirical analysis concerns the maize crops production of Italian provinces for 2017. The results point out the existence of great differences between North and South of Italy, where the impact of temperature variability tends to be more severe. The evidences also offer insights for regional planning and economic policies. The proposed methodology is very general and allows for a wider reproducibility for other crops and countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

As a consequence the income of rural populations will change, and with it the incentives for people to remain in rural areas. Using data from 115 countries between 1960 and 2000, we analyze the effect of differential warming trends across countries on the probability of either migrating out of the country or from rural to urban areas. We find that higher temperatures in middle-income economies increased migration rates to urban areas and to other countries. In poor countries, higher temperatures reduced the probability of migration to cities and to other countries, consistently with the presence of severe liquidity constraints. In middle-income countries, migration represents an important margin of adjustment to global warming, potentially contributing to structural change and even increasing income per worker. Such a mechanism, however, does not seem to work in poor economies.},

This paper therefore investigates the impact of climate change vulnerability and resilience on sovereign bond yields and spreads in 98 advanced and developing countries over the period 1995–2017. We find that the vulnerability and resilience to climate change have a significant impact on the cost government borrowing, after controlling for conventional determinants of sovereign risk. That is, countries that are more resilient to climate change have lower bond yields and spreads relative to countries with greater vulnerability to risks associated with climate change. Furthermore, partitioning the sample into country groups reveals that the magnitude and statistical significance of these effects are much greater in developing countries with weaker capacity to adapt to and mitigate the consequences of climate change.},

This paper investigates how weather anomalies affect global supply chains and inflation dynamics. Using monthly data for six large and well-diversified economies (China, the Euro area, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States) over the period 1997–2021, we implement a structural vector autoregressive model and document that weather anomalies could disrupt supply chains and subsequently lead to inflationary pressures. Our results—based on the monthly data and robust to alternative estimation methodologies—show that these effects vary across countries, depending on the severity of weather shocks and vulnerability to supply chain disruptions. The impact of weather shocks on supply chains and inflation dynamics is likely to become more pronounced with accelerating climate change that can have heterogeneous effects. These findings have important policy implications. Central bankers should consider the impact of weather anomalies on supply chains and inflation dynamics to prevent entrenching second-round effects and de-anchoring of inflation expectations. More directly, however, governments can invest more for climate change adaptation to strengthen critical infrastructure and thereby minimize supply chain disruptions.},

We find that Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, chronic and acute climate risks negatively affect financial stability at both the financial institution and system levels. Temperature anomalies, heat waves, wildfires and droughts are among the most significant risks. As Europe warms twice as fast as the rest of the world, our theoretical and empirical results urge regulators to mandatorily require the assessment and disclosure of corporate climate risks to allow banks to adjust their prudential capital requirements.},

I address this question by exploiting year-to-year seasonal variations in temperature and detailed crime data assembled from Savoyard criminal procedures over the period 1749–92. I find that temperature shocks had a positive and significant effect on the level of property crimes, but a negative and significant effect on violent crimes. I further document how seasonal migration helped to increase the coping capacity of local communities. Indeed, migrant labour both brought in remittances that supplemented communities’ resources, as well as temporarily relieved impoverished households of the burden of feeding these workers. I show that while temperature shocks were strongly associated with an increase in property crime rates, the effect was much lower in provinces with high levels of seasonal migration. I provide historical evidence demonstrating that the inflow of remittances may have driven this relationship.},

It is unclear how temperature variability, an indicator of climate change, is associated with meningitis incidence. Methods We used global meningitis incidence data along with meteorological and demographic data over 1990–2019 to identify the association between temperature variability and meningitis. We also employed future (2020–2100) climate data to predict meningitis incidence under different emission levels (SSPs: Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). Results We found that the mean temperature variability increased by almost 3 folds in the past 30~years. The largest changes occurred in Australasia, Tropical Latin America, and Central Sub-Saharan Africa. With a logarithmic unit increase in temperature variability, the overall global meningitis risk increases by 4.8~\%. Australasia, Central Sub-Saharan Africa, and High-income North America are the most at-risk regions. Higher statistical differences were identified in males, children, and the elderly population. Compared to high-emission (SSP585) scenario, we predicted a median reduction of 85.8~\% in meningitis incidence globally under the low-emission (SSP126) climate change scenario by 2100. Conclusion Our study provides evidence for temperature variability being in association with meningitis incidence, which suggests that global actions are urgently needed to address climate change and to prevent meningitis occurrence.},

  abstract = {Do food imports increase the variability of domestic food prices? The answer to this question depends on whether foreign production is more volatile than domestic production. If imports are likely to destabilize domestic prices, storing crops for future consumption may prove an appealing strategy to cope with the adverse supply effects of a more unstable climate. Unfortunately, public storage has proven to be unsustainable due to the high costs of carrying crop inventories over time and the inability of policy planners to correctly forecast changes in domestic supply. Therefore, understanding the roles of imports and stocks on domestic food price instability is important as domestic shortfalls in food production are likely to become more frequent as the world’s climate becomes warmer. Using maize prices observed in 76 maize markets of 27 maize net importers across Africa, Asia and Latin America during 2000–2015, we find that, on average, a 1\% increase in the ratio of imports to total consumption is correlated with a 0.29\% reduction of the intra-annual coefficient of variation of maize prices; likewise a 1\% increase in the amount of maize available in stocks at the beginning of the season is correlated with a 0.22\% reduction in the said coefficient. We also find that climate-induced supply shocks toward mid-century may increase maize price variability in the focus countries by around 10\%; these increases could be offset with similar increases in the ratio of imports to total consumption or in the stock-to-use ratio at the beginning of the crop marketing year. The fact that both imports and stocks help to stabilize domestic prices suggests that their uses should hinge on a careful cost-benefit analysis, including the risk of facing world production more variable than domestic production and the costs of carrying maize inventories over time.},

We further provide an analysis of trade-offs between various GI benefits. ‘Bundles’ of major co-benefits and trade-offs for each climate benefit can be identified with recommendations for strategies to maximize benefits and minimize trade-offs. To promote climate-resilient pathways through GI, it is crucial for decision-makers to identify opportunities to deliver multiple ecosystem services and benefits while recognizing disservices and trade-offs that need to be avoided or managed.},

  abstract = {In this work we investigate the response of daily electricity peak load to daily maximum temperatures across states in Europe and India. We propose a method that decomposes short- from medium/long-run effects, retains the high frequency nature of the load-weather covariation and treats economic growth as a modulating factor. By simultaneously exploiting variation in unexpected daily weather anomalies and decade-long climatic changes in each location we decompose transitory - intensive margin - adjustments from permanent - extensive margin - adjustments. We find that the shocks over the long-run differ substantially from the short-run dynamics. Furthermore, we find evidence that per capita income modulates the adjustments over the short- and long-run. We project that in response to climate change around 2050 the peak load may increase by up to 20\%-30\% in Southern Europe and in several states in India, depending on the degree of warming and the evolution of socio-economic conditions. Even with a limited scope to two world regions, we identify that the structure of the economy and differences in future income growth matter in shaping the adaptation to climate change. Our decomposition allows to identify how future weather anomalies can further amplify the relative increase associated to the shift in the climate norm. Assuming that the interannual variability of maximum temperatures follows the distribution observed in the past, we find a doubling of the impacts of climate change during the summer in Europe. Uncertainty around the distribution of future weather anomalies may lead to further unexpected peak load amplifications. Our results have important policy implications for power systems’ generation capacity, transmission and storage, as we show that the challenges to accommodate the peak load in days with extreme temperatures may substantially increase already around mid-century.},

  abstract = {Droughts can induce important building damages due to shrinking and swelling of soils, leading to costs as large as for floods in some regions. Previous studies have focused on damage data analysis, geological or constructional aspects. Here, a study investigating the climatic aspects of soil subsidence damage is presented for the first time. We develop a simple model to examine if the meteorology has a considerable impact on the interannual variability of damages from soil subsidence in France. We find that the model is capable of reproducing yearly drought-induced building damages for the time period 1989-2002, thus suggesting a strong meteorological influence. Furthermore, our results reveal a doubling of damages in these years compared to 1961-1990, mainly as a consequence of increasing temperatures. This indicates a link to climate change. We also apply the model to the extreme summer of 2003, which caused a further increase in damage by a factor four, according to a preliminary damage estimate. The simulation result for that year shows strong damage underestimation, pointing to additional sources of vulnerability. Damage data suggest a higher sensitivity to soil subsidence of regions first affected by drought in the 2003 summer, possibly due to a lack of preparedness and adaptation. This is of strong concern in the context of climate change, as densely populated regions in Central Europe and North America are expected to become newly affected by drought in the future. © Author(s) 2009.}

This study assesses the impact of the NAO, via wind-power generation, on the electricity market considering thermal generation costs, wholesale electricity prices and wind generation subsidies. A Monte Carlo approach is used to model NAO phases and generate hourly wind speed time-series data, electricity demand and fuel input data. A least-cost unit commitment and economic dispatch model is used to simulate an island electricity system, modelled on the all-island Irish electricity system. The impact of the NAO obviously depends on the level of wind capacity within an electricity system. Our results indicate that on average a switch from negative to positive NAO phase can reduce thermal generation costs by up to 8\%, reduce wholesale electricity prices by as much as €1.5/MWh, and increase wind power generators' revenue by 12\%. © 2016},

We performed age-specific Poisson regression models separately in the two periods, controlling for seasonality, air pollution and time trends. Distributed lag non-linear models were used to estimate the Relative Risks of daily mortality for increases in mean temperature from the 75th to 99th percentile of the summer distribution for each city. In the recent period, a reduction in the mortality risk associated to heat was observed only in Athens, Rome and Paris, especially among the elderly. Furthermore, in terms of heat-attributable mortality, 985, 787 and 623 fewer deaths were estimated, respectively, in the three cities. In Helsinki and Stockholm, there is a suggestion of increased heat effect. Noteworthy is that an effect of heat was still present in the recent years in all cities, ranging from +11\% to +35\%. In Europe, considering the warming observed in recent decades and population ageing, effective intervention measures should be promoted across countries, especially targeting vulnerable subgroups of the population with lower adaptive resources.},

Such events are detrimental for local economic activity but could also affect countries that are not directly exposed through global agricultural production shortfalls and price surges. Here, estimations for 75 countries show that increases in global agricultural commodity prices caused by harvest or weather disruptions in other regions of the world significantly curtail economic activity. The impact is considerably stronger in advanced countries, despite relatively lower shares of food in household expenditures. Effects are weaker when countries are net exporters of agricultural products, have large agricultural sectors and/or are less integrated in global markets for non-agricultural trade. Once we control for these characteristics, the relationship between the country’s income per capita and the economic repercussions becomes negative. Overall, these findings suggest that the consequences of climate change on advanced countries, particularly through food prices, may be larger than previously thought.},

  abstract = {A number of studies have shown that there is a time trend towards a reduction in the effects of heat on mortality. In the case of cold, however, there is practically no research of this type and so there is no clearly defined time trend of the impact of cold on mortality. Furthermore, no other specific studies have yet analysed the time trend of the impact of both thermal extremes by age group. We analysed data on daily mortality due to natural causes (ICD-10: A00-R99) in the city of Madrid across the period 2001–2009 and calculated the impact of extreme temperatures on mortality using Poisson regression models for specific age groups. The groups of age selected coinciding with the pre-existing age-groups analyzed in previous papers. For heat waves the groups of age used were: {$<$}10 years, 10–17 years, 18–44 years, 45–64 years, 65–74 years and over-75 years. For cold waves the groups of age used were: {$<$}1 year; 1–5 years, 6–17 years, 18–44 years, 45–64 years, 65–74 years and over-75 years. {$<$}1, 1–17, 18–44, 45–66, 65–74 and over-75 years. We controlled for confounding variables, such as air pollution, noise, influenza, pollen, pressure and relative humidity, trend of the series, as well as seasonalities and autoregressive components of the series. The results of these models were compared to those obtained for the same city during the period 1986–1997 and published in different studies. Our results show a lightly reduction in the effects of heat, especially in the over-45-year age group. In the case of cold, the behaviour pattern was the opposite, with an increase in its effect. Heat adaptation and socio-economic and public-health prevention and action measures may be behind this amelioration in the effects of heat, whereas the absence of such actions in respect of low temperatures may account for the increase in the effects of cold on mortality. From a public health point of view, the implementation of cold wave prevention plans covering all age groups is thus called for.},

  abstract = {Understanding the causes of economic inequality is critical for achieving equitable economic development. To investigate whether global warming has affected the recent evolution of inequality, we combine counterfactual historical temperature trajectories from a suite of global climate models with extensively replicated empirical evidence of the relationship between historical temperature fluctuations and economic growth. Together, these allow us to generate probabilistic country-level estimates of the influence of anthropogenic climate forcing on historical economic output. We find very high likelihood that anthropogenic climate forcing has increased economic inequality between countries. For example, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) has been reduced 17–31\% at the poorest four deciles of the population-weighted country-level per capita GDP distribution, yielding a ratio between the top and bottom deciles that is 25\% larger than in a world without global warming. As a result, although between-country inequality has decreased over the past half century, there is ~90\% likelihood that global warming has slowed that decrease. The primary driver is the parabolic relationship between temperature and economic growth, with warming increasing growth in cool countries and decreasing growth in warm countries. Although there is uncertainty in whether historical warming has benefited some temperate, rich countries, for most poor countries there is {$>$}90\% likelihood that per capita GDP is lower today than if global warming had not occurred. Thus, our results show that, in addition to not sharing equally in the direct benefits of fossil fuel use, many poor countries have been significantly harmed by the warming arising from wealthy countries’ energy consumption.}

In the data, a shock to global temperature dampens research and development (R\&D) expenditure growth. This novel empirical evidence is rationalized within a stochastic endogenous growth model. In the model, temperature shocks undermine economic growth via a drop in R\&D expenditure. We examine three theoretical channels of the negative R\&D expenditure effect of rising temperatures: the patent obsolescence channel, the labor productivity channel, and the capital quality channel. Temperature risk generates welfare costs of 93.14\% of lifetime utility in this benchmark model. Moreover, the government can offset these welfare costs by subsidizing investment with 7.04\% or R\&D expenditure with 3.81\% of total public spending, respectively. Alternatively, it can levy a lump-sum tax on households which finances 6.90\% of total public spending, reduce corporate taxes by 3.62 percentage points, or increase labor taxes by 2.80 percentage points.},

We find two primary results. First, higher intra-annual temperature variability reduces (increases) productivity in Europe and North America (Asia). Second, higher intra-annual temperature variability has no significant effects on productivity in Africa and South America. Additional empirical tests indicate also the following: (1) rising intra-annual temperature variability reduces productivity (even thought less significantly)in both tropical and non-tropical regions, (2) inter-annual temperature variability reduces (increases) productivity in North America (Europe) and (3) winter and summer inter-annual temperature variability generates a drop in productivity in both Europe and North America. Taken together, these findings indicate that temperature variability shocks tend to have stronger adverse economic effects among richer economies. In a production economy featuring long-run productivity and temperature volatility shocks, we quantify these negative impacts and find welfare losses of 2.9\% (1\%) in Europe (North America).},

The empirical findings suggest that El Niño boosts output with minimal inflationary effects, reducing global economic policy uncertainty, while La Niña raises food inflation, which can amplify aggregate inflation as a “second-round” effect, amplifying uncertainty. These findings shed light on the transmission channels of climate shocks and highlight the significant role of ENSO in shaping global economic conditions, emphasizing why climate shocks should be a concern for policy markers.},

However, there is no consensus among researchers on which similarity measure is most appropriate for normalization purposes. In this article, we theoretically analyze the properties of similarity measures for cooccurrence data, focusing in particular on four well-known measures: the association strength, the cosine, the inclusion index, and the Jaccard index. We also study the behavior of these measures empirically. Our analysis reveals that there exist two fundamentally different types of similarity measures, namely, set-theoretic measures and probabilistic measures. The association strength is a probabilistic measure, while the cosine, the inclusion index, and the Jaccard index are set-theoretic measures. Both our theoretical and our empirical results indicate that cooccurrence data can best be normalized using a probabilistic measure. This provides strong support for the use of the association strength in scientometric research.},

Indoor temperature exposures can vary substantially across households, even within a single geographic area. It is therefore critical to understand links between indoor temperature exposures and health or well-being outcomes, and to understand safe maximum indoor residential temperature thresholds that support health, well-being, and comfort. We systematically identified peer-reviewed, observational studies that quantified associations between residential indoor temperatures and mortality/morbidity outcomes. We extracted information on study location; population, health or well-being outcomes; indoor temperature exposure assessment methods; and, when available, empirically quantified safe maximum indoor temperature thresholds. In total, 29 papers were included in the review. The studies were conducted in the following continents: North America (N = 10), Europe (N = 5), Asia (N = 9), Australia (N = 4), and Africa (N = 1). The most common outcomes were cardiovascular morbidity (N~=~10) and respiratory morbidity (N~=~8) and thermal comfort (N~=~9). Exposure assessment methods included data sensors, thermometers, data-driven models, and energy-based simulations. Despite variation in exposure assessment methods and outcomes assessed, results predominately suggested that warmer indoor temperatures were associated with adverse health or well-being outcomes, although in a handful of studies, associations were either null or in the unexpected, protective direction. Empirically identified safe thresholds for indoor temperature ranged from 18~°C to 35~°C and varied according to outcome. Results from this review may be used to inform the design of future studies of associations between indoor temperatures and morbidity or mortality outcomes.},

This study assesses the complex interrelations between external framework conditions such as climate change or adjustments in the agricultural price and subsidy schemes with farmers’ decision-making. As social aspects remain understudied drivers for agricultural decisions, we also consider value-based characteristics of farmers as internal factors relevant for decision-making. We integrate individual learning as response to extreme weather events into an agent-based model that simulates farmers’ decision-making. We applied the model to a region in Eastern Austria that already experiences water scarcity and increasing drought risk from climate change and simulated three future scenarios to compare the effects of changes in socio-economic and climatic conditions. In a cross-comparison, we then investigated how farmers can navigate these changes through individual adaptation. The agricultural trajectories project a decline of active farms between −27 and −37\% accompanied by a reduction of agricultural area between −20 and −30\% until 2053. The results show that regardless of the scenario conditions, adaptation through learning moderates the decline in the number of active farms and farmland compared to scenarios without adaptive learning. However, adaptation increases the workload of farmers. This highlights the need for labor support for farms. © 2023, The Author(s).},

The critical appraisal of our results highlights that the literature does not reflect the diversity of renewable energy finance. Most studies focus on market-based policy instruments used to support renewable energy development in developed countries. Conversely, few studies of direct financing flows from the public and private sectors were found, while private sources provide an important part of renewable energy investment globally. Furthermore, the literature generally focuses on mature renewable electricity technologies (solar and wind). Our dynamic analysis reveals that private investment is an emerging subject.

  abstract = {Background To date, little is known about the temporal variation of the temperature-mortality association among different demographic and socio-economic groups. The aim of this work is to investigate trends in cold- and heat- attributable mortality risk and burden by sex, age, education, marital status, and number of household occupants in the city of Turin, Italy. Methods We collected daily time-series of temperature and mortality counts by demographic and socio-economic groups for the period 1982–2018 in Turin. We applied standard quasi-Poisson regression models to data subsets of 25-year moving subperiods, and we estimated the temperature-mortality associations with distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM). We provided cross-linkages between the evolution of minimum mortality temperatures, relative risks of mortality and temperature-attributable deaths under cold and hot conditions. Results Our findings highlighted an overall increase in risk trends under cold and heat conditions. All-cause mortality at the 1st percentile increased from 1.15 (95\% CI: 1.04; 1.28) in 1982–2006 to 1.24 (95\% CI: 1.11; 1.38) in 1994–2018, while at the 99th percentile the risk shifted from 1.51 (95\% CI: 1.41; 1.61) to 1.59 (95\% CI: 1.49; 1.71). In relation to social differences, women were characterized by greater values in respect to men, and similar estimates were observed among the elderly in respect to the youngest subgroup. Risk trends by educational subgroups were mixed, according to the reference temperature condition. Finally, individuals living in conditions of isolation were characterized by higher risks, with an increasing vulnerability throughout time. Conclusions The overall increase in cold- and heat- related mortality risk suggests a maladaptation to ambient temperatures in Turin. Despite alert systems in place increase public awareness and improve the efficiency of existing health services at the local level, they do not necessarily prevent risks in a homogeneous way. Targeted public health responses to cold and heat in Turin are urgently needed to adapt to extreme temperatures due to climate change.},

This paper, therefore, re-examines the relationship between weather changes and global livestock production using an established econometric strategy that takes care of the pitfalls inherent in the conventional approaches. Using country-level data and a variety of specifications, we find that a 1~°C increase in temperature will lead to a 9.7\% reduction in global beef production on average. These adverse effects are amplified in hot, poor, and agriculture-dependent countries. Besides, we find that a marginal increase in annual precipitation would lead to a 2.1\% increase in beef production in tropical countries but a 1.9\% decrease in temperate ones. Also, our forecasts show that climate change will reduce animal output by a further 20\% in the mid-century and an additional 40\% by the end of the century assuming no adaptation other than the degree of adaptation observed in the historical period.},

To assess changes in the occurrence and temperature excess of exceptional events across two 22-year subperiods (or phases), percentile-based thresholds were adopted. An inventive severity heatmap is used to illustrate exceptional Tmax changes between the two phases, which constitutes an addition to climate change research. Locations are categorised in the heatmap according to whether they experienced (i) more occurrences and more temperature excess, (ii) more occurrences but less temperature excess, (iii) fewer occurrences but more temperature excess, or (iv) fewer occurrences and less temperature excess. From the historical (1980–2002) to the contemporary (2002–2024) phase, results indicate a significant increase in the severity of extreme heat, particularly in central and southern Portugal, with over 90\% of locations exhibiting a rise in exceptional event occurrences. While the Student’s t-test indicated significant differences in both occurrence and temperature excess between the phases, Sen’s slope estimation showed steady upward trends. The results point to crucial regions in the interior and southern Portugal that have warmed the most, posing growing threats to agriculture, human health, and water resources. Although slight cooling trends were observed in a few northern and central coastal regions, the overall pattern highlights an increase in extreme heat. This research is particularly relevant given the recent changes in exceptional Tmax identified in Portugal, aligning with broader climate change patterns and trends.},

  abstract = {By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions:   \&ndash; How does the Earth system respond to forcing?  \&ndash; What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?   \&ndash; How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios?  This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

To safeguard farmers' income and food production, climate adaptation measures are required. This article aims to examine the effectiveness of crop diversification as an adaptation measure, using Italy as a case study. We apply a control function approach to a panel dataset of 20,790 Italian farms, which considers (i) the crop diversification decision and (ii) the influence of crop diversification on farmers' levels of crop income and income risk. We find that, while specialisation can increase income, crop diversification reduces income risk most effectively when growing four different crops. At this level of diversification, income risk is approximately 29\% lower as opposed to monoculture farming. Although the Common Agricultural Policy's greening payments for crop diversification make sense from an ecological and risk-reducing point of view, we find that they are potentially insufficient to cover the loss of expected crop income from diversification. While crop diversification reduces income risk in general, we find no specific benefit in terms of weather shock-induced risks. This may be because a price increase following a weather shock buffers its adverse effect. However, identifying the reasons requires further research.},

Using the dynamic panel data analysis, we find that the effect of the weather variables (e.g. snow depth, cloudiness or sunshine) is quite small, with a change in one standard deviation of the variation over time in each weather variable, leading to a 2–3 \% change in overnight stays. Furthermore, domestic tourists are more sensitive to changes in weather conditions than foreign tourists. By contrast, overnight stays of foreign visitors are much more responsive to changes in income than it is the case for domestic overnight stays. The occurrence of extreme snow-deficient winters, such as the winter of 2006–2007, in the future period will reduce overnight stays of foreign and domestic visitors by 2 and 5 \%, respectively.

In this paper, we investigated how droughts affect selected ecosystem services expected to result in welfare losses in Spain. This study is aimed at quantifying and simulating societal losses given the expected potential increase in drought severity in the coming decades. We estimated a Discrete Choice Latent Class Model by which we distinguished three broad classes of individuals. The common behavior across all classes is that people consistently choose to avoid the negative effects of droughts. However, there are substantial differences among the three classes; while class 1 chooses options regardless of cost, even when selecting the most expensive ones, the other two classes account for the size of the payment. Moreover, health and water use restrictions have been decisive factors in individuals' choices. We have also observed that the perception of climate change is related to individual decisions. We quantified the enormous damage drought causes to societal well-being. Policymakers should take this information into account when addressing the increasing likelihood of extreme weather events. © 2024 The Authors},

This paper presents a new data set that links weather data to annual average night-light emission data for 24.000 0.5°× 0.5° grid-cells around the globe for the period 1992–2013. Interpreting night-light emission as a proxy for economic activity, these data allow one to investigate how weather anomalies affect economic activity. Global coverage avoids selection bias, while high spatial resolution avoids averaging out heterogeneity in local impacts at higher aggregation levels. Our data show significant effects on the local growth of night-light for storms, excessive precipitation, droughts, and cold spells. Moreover, we find evidence for significant spatial spillovers to neighboring areas. Our results suggest that these offsetting spillovers are typically local. As positive and negative effects average out in larger areas, our results call for the analysis of economic effects of weather anomalies at a high geographical resolution. Finally, our results are driven by events in lower income regions. As climate change is expected to make weather patterns more erratic, our new data can inform emerging debates on how this will affect the economy in both science and politics.},

We build a comprehensive database of disaster events and their intensities from primary geophysical and meteorological information. In contrast to insurance data, our GeoMet data reveal a substantial negative and robust average impact effect of disasters on growth. The worst 5\% disaster years come with a growth damage of at least 0.46 percentage points. That average effect is driven mainly by very large earthquakes and some meteorological disasters. Poor countries are more strongly affected by geophysical disasters; rich more by meteorological events. International openness and democratic institutions reduce the adverse effect of disasters.},

Individual data, relative to the resident population of Udine, a city in northeastern Italy, under French domination (1806–1815) have been used. The information collected regards births and deaths within the first month of life and is taken from the Napoleonic civil registers. The spatial distribution of some data within the urban area, heating in the houses where children were born or died, and a time series of temperature levels and corn prices are taken into account. The methodological approach adopted is based on logistic regression models and discrete-time event history analysis. The results point to excess winter neonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality was higher in peripheral areas of the city and in heated houses. A positive relationship between mortality and lower temperatures and corn prices has been found. As to socioeconomic status, peasant families and those of the upper class showed, respectively, the lowest and the highest mortality levels. This was arguably the result of the adoption of different breastfeeding practices. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Several regions are likely to be exposed to multiple climate hazards, yet their modeling in a joint scheme is still at the early stages. A multi-hazard framework to map exposure to multiple climate extremes in Europe along the twenty-first century is hereby presented. Using an ensemble of climate projections, changes in the frequency of heat and cold waves, river and coastal flooding, streamflow droughts, wildfires and windstorms are evaluated. Corresponding variations in expected annual exposure allow for a quantitative comparison of hazards described by different process characteristics and metrics. Projected changes in exposure depict important variations in hazard scenarios, especially those linked to rising temperatures, and spatial patterns largely modulated by local climate conditions. Results show that Europe will likely face a progressive increase in overall climate hazard with a prominent spatial gradient towards south-western regions mainly driven by the rise of heat waves, droughts and wildfires. Key hotspots emerge particularly along coastlines and in floodplains, often highly populated and economically pivotal, where floods and windstorms could be critical in combination with other climate hazards. Projected increases in exposure will be larger for very extreme events due to their pronounced changes in frequency. Results of this appraisal provide useful input for forthcoming European disaster risk and adaptation policy. © 2016, The Author(s).}

Accurately quantifying PWC is essential for forecasting impacts of different climate change scenarios, but the current state of knowledge is limited, leading to potential underestimations in mild heat, and overestimations in extreme heat. We therefore developed advanced empirical equations for PWC based on 338 work sessions in climatic chambers (low air movement, no solar radiation) spanning mild to extreme heat stress. Equations for PWC are available based on air temperature and humidity, for a suite of heat stress assessment metrics, and mean skin temperature. Our models are highly sensitive to mild heat and to our knowledge are the first to include empirical data across the full range of warm and hot environments possible with future climate change across the world. Using wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) as an example, we noted 10\% reductions in PWC at mild heat stress (WBGT = 18°C) and reductions of 78\% in the most extreme conditions (WBGT = 40°C). Of the different heat stress indices available, the heat index was the best predictor of group level PWC (R2 = 0.96) but can only be applied in shaded conditions. The skin temperature, but not internal/core temperature, was a strong predictor of PWC (R2 = 0.88), thermal sensation (R2 = 0.84), and thermal comfort (R2 = 0.73). The models presented apply to occupational workloads and can be used in climate projection models to predict economic and social consequences of climate change.},

The paper aims to (i) describe observed trends and scenarios for summer heat waves, windstorms and heavy precipitation, based on results from simulations with global circulation models, regional climate models, and other downscaling procedures, and (ii) discuss potential impacts on agricultural systems and forests in Switzerland. Trends and scenarios project more frequent heavy precipitation during winter corresponding, for example, to a three-fold increase in the exceedance of today's 15-year extreme values by the end of the 21st century. This increases the risk of large-scale flooding and loss of topsoil due to erosion. In contrast, constraints in agricultural practice due to waterlogged soils may become less in a warmer climate. In summer, the most remarkable trend is a decrease in the frequency of wet days, and shorter return times of heat waves and droughts. This increases the risk of losses of crop yield and forage quality. In forests, the more frequent occurrence of dry years may accelerate the replacement of sensitive tree species and reduce carbon stocks, and the projected slight increase in the frequency of extreme storms by the end of the century could increase the risk of windthrow. Some possible measures to maintain goods and services of agricultural and forest ecosystems are mentioned, but it is suggested that more frequent extremes may have more severe consequences than progressive changes in means. In order to effectively decrease the risk for social and economic impacts, long-term adaptive strategies in agriculture and silviculture, investments for prevention, and new insurance concepts seem necessary. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

The literature addresses this question in two isolated ways: either by looking at long-term effects through the prism of calibrated theoretical models, or by focusing on both short and long terms through the lens of empirical models. We propose a framework that reconciles these two approaches by taking the theory to the data in two complementary ways. We first document the propagation mechanism of a weather shock using a Vector Auto-Regressive model on New Zealand Data. To explain the mechanism, we build and estimate a general equilibrium model with a weather-dependent agricultural sector to investigate the weather’s business cycle implications. We find that weather shocks: (i) explain about 35\% of GDP and agricultural output fluctuations in New Zealand; (ii) entail a welfare cost of 0.30\% of permanent consumption; (iii) critically increases the macroeconomic volatility under climate change, resulting in a higher welfare cost peaking to 0.46\% in the worst case scenario of climate change.},

  abstract = {In biomedical research, a health effect is frequently associated with protracted exposures of varying intensity sustained in the past. The main complexity of modeling and interpreting such phenomena lies in the additional temporal dimension needed to express the association, as the risk depends on both intensity and timing of past exposures. This type of dependency is defined here as exposure–lag–response association. In this contribution, I illustrate a general statistical framework for such associations, established through the extension of distributed lag non-linear models, originally developed in time series analysis. This modeling class is based on the definition of a cross-basis, obtained by the combination of two functions to flexibly model linear or nonlinear exposure-responses and the lag structure of the relationship, respectively. The methodology is illustrated with an example application to cohort data and validated through a simulation study. This modeling framework generalizes to various study designs and regression models, and can be applied to study the health effects of protracted exposures to environmental factors, drugs or carcinogenic agents, among others. © 2013 The Authors.

By putting into perspective various case studies, we provide a broader context and improved understanding of climate changes on energy production. We also underline the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches used as far as technical, physical and economical aspects are concerned. Although the catchments under investigation are located close to each other in geographic terms (Swiss and Italian Alps), they represent a wide variety of situations which may be affected by differing evolutions for instance in terms of annual runoff. In this study, we also differentiate between run-of-river, storage and pumping-storage power plants. By integrating and comparing various analyses carried out in the framework of the EU-FP7 ACQWA project, this paper discusses the complexity as well as current and future issues of hydropower management in the entire Alpine region.},

  abstract = {In recent years, floods have become one of the natural hazards that generate the greatest economic and human losses on the planet. As is well known, torrential rainfall events are the triggering factor for flooding processes; nevertheless, it is worth examining the responsibility of the human factor, such as urban development, in the occurrence of these potential natural disasters. To this end, rainfall observations obtained during different precipitation events have been analysed. The evolution and urban development from the growth of the number of buildings was also examined. The information obtained has been crossed with the digital cartography of flooded areas (National System of Flood Zones Cartography, SNCZI in Spanish acronym). The results obtained show that the last two extraordinary rainfall events (December 2016 and September 2019) that occurred in the municipalities of Los Alcázares and San Javier (Region of Murcia, SE Spain) exceeded 200~mm, and quantified very high hourly intensities ({$>$} 50~mm/h). On the other hand, the number of buildings constructed and the built-up area in both municipalities has increased notably, with an evolution between 1950 and 2019 from 1057 to 15,969 buildings constructed, increasing from 16.09~ha. to 450.06~ha. occupied. This real estate development has caused the number of buildings exposed to flooding to reach 3840 in 2019 for a 10-year RP (return period) and 5941 for a 500-year RP. It can be concluded by indicating the clear influence of territorial transformation on the increase of exposure and economic losses generated by flood events. © 2022, The Author(s).},

This paper summarizes interrelationships of weather and transport for different transport modes from both supply and demand side perspectives on the basis of a literature review. To further explore the complexity of these interrelationships, it also evaluates news items (n\,=\,839) in a sample of global media news outlets covering the world and population-dense world regions. Results confirm that extreme events have become disruptive of transport systems at the micro and macro scale, also affecting transport behavior. There are implications for environment, economy, technology, health, and society. Interrelationships are illustrated and discussed: Climatic impact drivers can be expected to increase transport vulnerabilities and risks, and have relevance for transport planning and adaptation.},

Using this data, take-off performance was analysed for the DHC-8-400—a typical short range turboprop airliner, and the A320, a typical medium scale turbofan airliner. For airports with longer runways, a steady but unimportant increase in take-off distances was found. For airports with shorter runways, the results indicate a steady reduction in available payload. At the most extreme case, results show that for an Airbus A320, operating from the, relatively short, 1511m runway at Chios Airport, the required reduction in payload would be equivalent to 38 passengers with their luggage, or fuel for 700 nautical miles (1300~km) per flight, for the period between the A320’s entry to service in 1988 and 2017. These results indicate that for airports where aeroplane maximum take-off mass is a performance limited function of runway length, and where minimum temperatures have increased and/or mean headwind components decreased, climate change has already had a marked impact on the economic activity in the airline industry. Similar analyses could be usefully carried out for other runway-length–limited airports, which may often include island airports. It is also noted that previous research has only considered temperature effects, and not wind effects. Wind effects in this study are less significant than temperature, but nonetheless have an effect on both field performance noise and pollution nuisance around airports. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Yet, the search systems allowing access to this evidence provide varying levels of precision, recall, and reproducibility and also demand different levels of effort. To date, it remains unclear which search systems are most appropriate for evidence synthesis and why. Advice on which search engines and bibliographic databases to choose for systematic searches is limited and lacking systematic, empirical performance assessments. This study investigates and compares the systematic search qualities of 28 widely used academic search systems, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science. A novel, query-based method tests how well users are able to interact and retrieve records with each system. The study is the first to show the extent to which search systems can effectively and efficiently perform (Boolean) searches with regards to precision, recall, and reproducibility. We found substantial differences in the performance of search systems, meaning that their usability in systematic searches varies. Indeed, only half of the search systems analyzed and only a few Open Access databases can be recommended for evidence syntheses without adding substantial caveats. Particularly, our findings demonstrate why Google Scholar is inappropriate as principal search system. We call for database owners to recognize the requirements of evidence synthesis and for academic journals to reassess quality requirements for systematic reviews. Our findings aim to support researchers in conducting better searches for better evidence synthesis.},

  abstract = {Background Reporting standards, such as PRISMA aim to ensure that the methods and results of systematic reviews are described in sufficient detail to allow full transparency. Flow diagrams in evidence syntheses allow the reader to rapidly understand the core procedures used in a review and examine the attrition of irrelevant records throughout the review process. Recent research suggests that use of flow diagrams in systematic reviews is poor and of low quality and called for standardised templates to facilitate better reporting in flow diagrams. The increasing options for interactivity provided by the Internet gives us an opportunity to support easy-to-use evidence synthesis tools, and here we report on the development of a tool for the production of PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Methods and Findings We developed a free-to-use, Open Source R package and web-based Shiny app to allow users to design PRISMA flow diagrams for their own systematic reviews. Our tool allows users to produce standardised visualisations that transparently document the methods and results of a systematic review process in a variety of formats. In addition, we provide the opportunity to produce interactive, web-based flow diagrams (exported as HTML files), that allow readers to click on boxes of the diagram and navigate to further details on methods, results or data files. We provide an interactive example here; https://prisma-flowdiagram.github.io/. Conclusions We have developed a user-friendly tool for producing PRISMA 2020-compliant flow diagrams for users with coding experience and, importantly, for users without prior experience in coding by making use of Shiny (https://estech.shinyapps.io/prisma\_flowdiagram/). This free-to-use tool will make it easier to produce clear and PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Significantly, users can also produce interactive flow diagrams for the first time, allowing readers of their reviews to smoothly and swiftly explore and navigate to further details of the methods and results of a review. We believe this tool will increase use of PRISMA flow diagrams, improve the compliance and quality of flow diagrams, and facilitate strong science communication of the methods and results of systematic reviews by making use of interactivity. We encourage the systematic review community to make use of the tool, and provide feedback to streamline and improve their usability and efficiency.},

  abstract = {With increasing flood risk due to climate change and socioeconomic trends, governments are under pressure to continue implementing flood protection measures, such as dikes, to reduce flood risk. However, research suggests that a sole focus on government-funded flood protection leads to an adverse increase in exposure as people and economic activities tend to concentrate in protected areas. Moreover, governmental flood protection can reduce the incentive for autonomous adaptation by local households, which paradoxically results in more severe consequences if an extreme flood event occurs. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ‘safe development paradox’ or ‘levee effect’ and is generally not accounted for in existing flood risk models used to assess developments in future flood risk under climate change. In this study we assess the impact of extreme flood events for the European Union using a large-scale agent-based model (ABM). We quantify how the safe development paradox affects (1) population growth and the increase in exposed property values, (2) the reduction in investments to flood-proof buildings as public protection increases, and (3) the increase in potential damage should a flood occur. For this analysis, we apply an ABM that integrates the dynamic behaviour of governments and residents into a large-scale flood risk assessment framework, in which we include estimates of changing population growth. We find that the impact of extreme flood events increases considerably when governments provide high protection levels, especially in large metropolitan areas. Moreover, we demonstrate how policy that stimulates the flood-proofing of buildings can largely counteract the effects of the safe development paradox. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Using Hungarian administrative data spanning 1984 to 2018, this paper estimates the effect of temperature on the weekly spontaneous pregnancy loss rate. We show that, compared to a mild temperature, heat causes a substantial increase in the risk of pregnancy loss, whereas cold temperatures slightly decrease it. These impacts are not due to near-term displacement of some pregnancy losses but represent changes in the pregnancy outcomes. Combining the estimated effects with outputs of thirty climate models implies that climate change will increase the spontaneous pregnancy loss rate in the 21st century. The risk of pregnancy loss will be especially elevated during summer.},

Our model exhibits a larger response to natural disasters during expansions than during recessions. This apparently paradoxical result can be traced to the disasters amplifying pre-existing disequilibria during expansions, while the existence of unused resources during recessions damps the exogenous shocks. It thus appears that high-growth periods are also highly vulnerable to supply-side shocks. In our EnBC model, the average production loss due to a set of disasters distributed at random in time is highly sensitive to the dynamical characteristics of the impacted economy. Larger economic flexibility allows for a more efficient and rapid response to supply-side shocks and reduces production losses. On the other hand, too high a flexibility can lead to vulnerability phases that cause average production losses to soar. These results raise questions about the assessment of climate change damages or natural disaster losses that are based purely on long-term growth models.},

  abstract = {Extreme events are one of the main channels through which climate and socioeconomic systems interact, and it is likely that climate change will modify the probability distribution of the losses they generate. The long-term growth models used in climate change assessments, however, cannot capture the effects of such short-term shocks. To investigate this issue, a non-equilibrium dynamic model (NEDyM) is used to assess the macroeconomic consequences of extreme events. This exercise allowed us to define the economic amplification ratio, as the ratio of the overall production loss due to an event to its direct costs. This ratio could be used to improve the cost–benefit analysis of prevention measures. We found also that, unlike a Solow-like model, NEDyM exhibits a bifurcation in GDP losses: for each value of the capacity to fund reconstruction, GDP losses remain moderate if the intensity and frequency of extremes remain under a threshold value, beyond which GDP losses increase sharply. This bifurcation may partly explain why some poor countries that experience repeated natural disasters cannot develop. Applied to the specific issue of climate change, this model highlights the importance of short-term constraints in the assessment of long-term damages, and shows that changes in the distribution of extremes may entail significant GDP losses in absence of specific adaptation. It suggests, therefore, that to avoid inaccurately low assessments of damages, researchers must take into account the distribution of extremes instead of their average cost and make explicit assumptions on the organization of future economies.},

We have considered a number of case studies that illustrate how linkages can be established between geographically detailed climate data and economic information. The case studies included wheat production in agriculture, where regional climate data has been linked to farm enterprise data in an integrated model of physical conditions, production inputs and outputs, and farm management practices. Similarly, temperature data were used to assess consequences of extreme heat and excess mortality in urban areas. We give an introduction of an analytical approach for assessing economic impacts of climate change and discuss how economic concepts and valuation paradigms can be applied to climate change impact evaluation. A number of methodological difficulties encountered in economic assessments of climate change impacts are described and a number of issues related to social and private aspects of costs are highlighted. It is argued that, in particular, detailed climate information matters in relation to understanding how private agents react to observed climate data.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a first estimate of the exposure of the world's large port cities (population exceeding one million inhabitants in 2005) to coastal flooding due to sea-level rise and storm surge now and in the 2070s, taking into account scenarios of socio-economic and climate changes. The analysis suggests that about 40 million people (0.6\% of the global population or roughly 1 in 10 of the total port city population in the cities considered) are currently exposed to a 1 in 100 year coastal flood event. For assets, the total value exposed in 2005 across all cities considered is estimated to be US\$3,000 billion; corresponding to around 5\% of global GDP in 2005 (both measured in international USD) with USA, Japan and the Netherlands being the countries with the highest values. By the 2070s, total population exposed could grow more than threefold due to the combined effects of sea-level rise, subsidence, population growth and urbanisation with asset exposure increasing to more than ten times current levels or approximately 9\% of projected global GDP in this period. On the global-scale, population growth, socio-economic growth and urbanization are the most important drivers of the overall increase in exposure particularly in developing countries, as low-lying areas are urbanized. Climate change and subsidence can significantly exacerbate this increase in exposure. Exposure is concentrated in a few cities: collectively Asia dominates population exposure now and in the future and also dominates asset exposure by the 2070s. Importantly, even if the environmental or socio-economic changes were smaller than assumed here the underlying trends would remain. This research shows the high potential benefits from risk-reduction planning and policies at the city scale to address the issues raised by the possible growth in exposure. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.}

  abstract = {Worldwide, landslides incur catastrophic and significant economic and human losses. Previous studies have characterized the patterns in landslides' fatalities, from all kinds of triggering causes, at a continental or global scale, but they were based on data from periods of {$<$}10\,years. The research herein presented hypothesizes that climate change associated with extreme rainfall and population distribution is contributing to a higher number of deadly landslides worldwide. This study maps and identified deadly landslides in 128 countries and it encompasses their role, for a 20\,years' period from January/1995 to December/2014, considered representative for establishing a relationship between landslides and their meteorological triggers. A database of georeferenced landslides, their date, and casualties' information, duly validated, was implemented. A hot spot analysis for the daily record of landslide locations was performed, as well as a percentile-based approach to evaluate the trend of extreme rainfall events for each occurrence. The relationship between casualty, population distribution, and rainfall was also evaluated. For 20\,years, 3876 landslides caused a total of 163,658 deaths and 11,689 injuries globally. They occurred most frequently between June and December in the Northern Hemisphere, and between December and February in the Southern Hemisphere. A significant global rise in the number of deadly landslides and hotspots across the studied period was observed. Analysis of daily rainfall confirmed that more than half of the events were in areas exposed to the risk of extreme rainfall. The relationships established between extreme rainfall, population distribution, seasonality, and landslides provide a useful basis for efforts to model the adverse impacts of extreme rainfall due to climate change and human activities and thus contribute towards a more resilient society.},

  abstract = {Stable food production is vital for food security. Stability of farm income is also necessary to ensure the sustainability of food production and to protect livelihoods, in a changing climate. We analyse the relative effects of climate variability, subsidies and farming practices on the stability of food production and farm income. We examine farms in England and Wales between 2005 and 2017, and link farms to climate data at a sub-regional scale. Our results show that variability in temperature and rainfall reduces the stability of farm income and food production. While variability in climate can be largely outside of the farmers control our findings indicate that, under current conditions, farm management can have a larger effect on stability than climate. We identified three key aspects of farm management and policy that improve stability: i) increasing agricultural diversity, ii) increasing the efficiency of agrochemical use and iii) agri-environmental management. These management practices have previously been associated with benefits to natural ecosystems and may therefore increase the stability of agriculture whilst reducing negative impacts of farming on the environment. We also found differences in effect size of climate impacts and adaptation options between farm types, emphasising the need for flexible agricultural policies.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the construction of an updated gridded climate dataset (referred to as CRU TS3.10) from monthly observations at meteorological stations across the world's land areas. Station anomalies (from 1961 to 1990 means) were interpolated into 0.5° latitude/longitude grid cells covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), and combined with an existing climatology to obtain absolute monthly values. The dataset includes six mostly independent climate variables (mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, precipitation, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure and cloud cover). Maximum and minimum temperatures have been arithmetically derived from these. Secondary variables (frost day frequency and potential evapotranspiration) have been estimated from the six primary variables using well-known formulae. Time series for hemispheric averages and 20 large sub-continental scale regions were calculated (for mean, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation totals) and compared to a number of similar gridded products. The new dataset compares very favourably, with the major deviations mostly in regions and/or time periods with sparser observational data. CRU TS3.10 includes diagnostics associated with each interpolated value that indicates the number of stations used in the interpolation, allowing determination of the reliability of values in an objective way. This gridded product will be publicly available, including the input station series (http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/ and http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/cru/). © 2013 Royal Meteorological Society},

We construct a model that incorporates transmission mechanism of floods and estimate the model using the data of flood-induced damage to capital stock and public infrastructure collected by the government in the last 40 years. The result of the analysis is threefold. First, a flood that reduces the private capital stock by about 0.1\% as a direct effect causes GDP to fall by about 0.1\% in the first period, with a gradual recovery to pre-flood level. Second, floods dampen GDP through multiple channels. From the supply side, a decline in capital stock inputs and total factor productivity (TFP) reduce GDP. From the demand side, the balance sheets of firms and financial intermediaries are impaired, resulting in disruptions to financial intermediation and depressing GDP. Based on our estimates, all these channels are quantitatively comparable in magnitude. Third, the quantitative impacts of flood shocks on GDP up to now have been minor compared to the standard structural shocks that are considered important in existing macroeconomic studies. However, according to the estimates that use the relationship between the key variables in our model together with climate change scenarios published by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), the impacts of these shocks could become somewhat larger in the future.},

We also find that weather impacts per capita GDP growth through all its factors of production, with the largest impacts on total factor productivity. Again it is the poor countries for which these impacts are the strongest.

  abstract = {As extreme weather events affect the core business of insurance this industry has quite early addressed potential effects of natural climate cycles and global warming on natural catastrophe hazards. Munich Re's experts have been researching loss events caused by natural hazards around the globe for 40 years. These losses are documented in the NatCatSERVICE database currently documenting more than 36,000 single events. The analyses of the NatCatSERVICE data clearly show a high interannual variability, in some regions decadal oscillations, and a long term trend to an increase in the number of natural catastrophes around the globe, with ever growing losses. The trend curve indicating the number of loss relevant natural catastrophes worldwide reveals an increase by a factor of about three within the last 35 years. As the rise in the number of natural catastrophes is predominantly attributable to weather-related events like storms and floods, with no relevant increase in geophysical events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions, there is some justification in assuming that changes in the atmosphere, and global warming in particular, play a relevant role.However, the main contribution to the upward trend of the losses caused by natural catastrophes comes from socio-economic/demographic factors such as population growth, ongoing urbanization and increasing values being exposed. Prevention measures, especially flood protection programs, on the other hand have a high potential to even reduce losses while the hazard has increased. Because of such factors influencing the loss trends a clear attribution of at least part of the effects to global warming is very difficult. There is, however, an increasing number of studies, which show significant increases in losses in some regions and for some perils even after they have been normalized to the exposed values today.Looking at trends of extreme weather events and their effects, natural climate variability has to be considered. Short term oscillations such as ENSO as well as decadal oscillations in hurricane (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) or typhoon activity (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) still play a dominant role on the variability of losses caused by weather extremes. As global warming will continue in the coming decades, its contribution to increasing natural catastrophe losses will become more prominent, a projection also given by the 5th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2014).As long as the risks from weather related disasters stay calculable and the insureds can afford a risk adequate premium there is no danger that such risks become uninsurable. Insurers, however, have to invest more resources into analyses of trends and have to assure that premiums for the risks they cover always reflect a dynamic hazard pattern.There is no sensible way to interfere with natural climate oscillations influencing natural catastrophe losses. Humankind, however, still has the chance to avoid catastrophic increases of losses caused by global warming driven weather extremes by ambitious climate protection and adaptation measures. © 2015 The Author.},

Our findings show a significant and sizeable effect of temperature anomalies, heat episodes and dry spells on environmental concern and voting for Green parties. The magnitude of the climate effect differs substantially across European regions. It is stronger in regions with a cooler Continental or temperate Atlantic climate and weaker in regions with a warmer Mediterranean climate. The relationships are moderated by regional income level suggesting that climate change experiences increase public support for climate action but only under favourable economic conditions. The findings have important implications for the current efforts to promote climate action in line with the Paris Agreement.},

We develop a static CGE model, which zooms into one single period of a standard Auerbach-Kotlikoff model. While we observe private and instantaneous adaptation in reaction to price changes, we explicitly model public adaptation funded by taxing either labor or capital. We apply our model to heat waves in Switzerland and are able to show that heat waves affect cohorts' utility in an unadapted economy in substantially different ways. While young and less vulnerable cohorts profit (in welfare terms and because of inheritance) from heat waves, vulnerable but surviving cohorts' welfare decreases substantially. Thus, without adaptation, vulnerable cohorts are worse off and might have even fewer possibilities to invest in private adaptation in the long run. Overall, we show that with adaptation, the negative impact of a 2003-like heat wave on output can be reduced from about −0.5\% of GDP to −0.04\% of GDP. Additionally, equivalent variation is reduced from about −1\% to −0.18\%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Applying consistent climate change driven productivity shocks to a global multi-commodity agricultural market model we show that the negative direct effects from climate change on crop production in the EU could be offset by market and trade adjustments. The simulations reveal that climate change has heterogeneous impacts across regions. EU farming sector, in particular, might actually benefit from climate change as the impacts on agricultural productivity are expected to be more severe in important non-EU production regions such as US, Russia and Ukraine, depending on the crop. Higher producer prices for important crops such as wheat, barley, grain maize, rice and soybeans, lead to an increase in EU production and exports. For instance EU wheat production could increase by 13\% and exports by 28\%, with 19\% higher farm incomes on average than in a business-as-usual situation. Our study has several limitations. In particular, we do not consider CO2 fertilization effects and direct effect from climate change on livestock sector, climate variability and extreme weather effects. Notwithstanding, our findings highlight the heterogeneity of climate change impacts across regions, specifically Northern versus Southern Europe, and the importance of market and trade adjustments as economic adaptation mechanisms to climate change. © 2023 The Author(s).

Now a new analysis examines whether civil conflicts might be linked to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the dominant mode of interannual variability in the modern global climate. Using data on tropical countries collected between 1950 and 2004, the study finds that the probability of new civil conflicts breaking out in El Niño years is double that seen in cooler La Niña years. Overall, these findings suggest that the ENSO may have played a part in initiating 21\% of all civil conflicts since 1950. This study represents the first demonstration that the stability of modern societies is associated with the global climate.},

Here, I review, synthesize, and interpret recent advances in methods used to measure effects of climate on social and economic outcomes. Because weather variation plays a large role in recent progress, I formalize the relationship between climate and weather from an econometric perspective and discuss the use of these two factors as identifying variation, highlighting trade-offs between key assumptions in different research designs and deriving conditions when weather variation exactly identifies the effects of climate. I then describe recent advances, such as the parameterization of climate variables from a social perspective, use of nonlinear models with spatial and temporal displacement, characterization of uncertainty, measurement of adaptation, cross-study comparison, and use of empirical estimates to project the impact of future climate change. I conclude by discussing remaining methodological challenges.},

Drawing from archaeology, criminology, economics, geography, history, political science, and psychology, we assemble and analyze the 60 most rigorous quantitative studies and document, for the first time, a striking convergence of results. We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across a range of spatial and temporal scales and across all major regions of the world. The magnitude of climate’s influence is substantial: for each one standard deviation (1σ) change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises 4\% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises 14\%. Because locations throughout the inhabited world are expected to warm 2σ to 4σ by 2050, amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical impact of anthropogenic climate change.}

This study shows that in 28 Caribbean-basin countries, the response of economic output to increased temperatures is structurally similar to the response of labor productivity to high temperatures, a mechanism omitted from economic models of future climate change. This similarity is demonstrated by isolating the direct influence of temperature from that of tropical cyclones, an important correlate. Notably, output losses occurring in nonagricultural production (–2.4\%/+1 °C) substantially exceed losses occurring in agricultural production (–0.1\%/+1 °C). Thus, these results suggest that current models of future climate change that focus on agricultural impacts but omit the response of workers to thermal stress may underestimate the global economic costs of climate change.}

Similar patterns emerge when examining the effects of temperature bins, seasonal mean temperature, temperature variations, and temperature shocks. Furthermore, we identify substantial heterogeneity in the impact across countries with varying income levels, age structures, and education levels. Finally, by comparing the baseline model with a long-difference model, we demonstrate that long-term adaptation may not significantly mitigate the impact of global warming on obesity in temperate zones.},

Benefits of HIA can result from incorporating public health evidence in non-health decision making and offers opportunities to emphasize health equity. Specifically, HIA tools can be leveraged to address equity, cost-effectiveness, and efficacy of policies in emerging public health threats. In 2023, the U.S. Surgeon General announced social isolation and loneliness as an undervalued national epidemic and budding public health emergency. The use of HIA for public health emergency response planning represents a unique opportunity to address the increased risk of isolation and loneliness as facets of overall mental health and wellbeing. We aimed to review HIA use for public health emergencies and their associated impacts on mental health, focusing on loneliness and isolation as symptoms or markers of adverse mental health outcomes. A scoping review of the literature was performed and identified seven articles of interest. We offer insights on barriers, catalysts, and facilitators of the HIA process in emergency response planning. Additionally, we synthesize the identified barriers and facilitators to propose a conceptual thematic visual of HIA engagement to enhance community education and involvement in decision and policy making. Our findings suggest an increasing need for public health emergency preparedness approaches incorporating partnerships and community engagement, particularly through expanded application of HIA methodologies focused on social isolation and loneliness as determinants of mental health outcomes during and after emergencies.},

With continued global temperature increases, extreme thresholds relevant to health will be exceeded more frequently. This study provides an updated spatial analysis of heat-related mortality for the UK, using the UK Climate Projections (UKCP18) at 1.5 °C-4 °C global warming levels, and embedding population and demographic data from the recently released UK Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (UK-SSPs). Climate change will lead to an increase in heat-related mortality in the future, exacerbated by increased exposure due to increasing population. We find an increase from ~1400 average annual deaths in the near-past (1990-2019) (95\% CI: 1299-1485), to ~2500 (2304-2794), ~3700 (3280-4214), ~8200 (7376-9072) and {$>$}18 000 (16 690-20 394) average annual deaths at 1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C and 4 °C respectively (assuming no adaptation). This is considered a high-end estimate due to the assumption of high population growth (UK-SSP5). Older populations are shown to be most vulnerable. A large proportion of heat-related deaths (76\% (74\%-79\%) with 1.5 °C global warming) are attributed to more moderate (1 °C-5 °C) increases above regional temperature thresholds as opposed to extremes. Our results provide a timely update that can serve as a first step to supporting future UK climate policy and risk assessments.

In addition, the results of recent studies that link demographic and climate data are not consistent with conventional narratives of displacement responses. Using longitudinal individual-level demographic data from the Historical Sample of the Netherlands and climate data that cover the same period, we examine the effects of climate variability on migration using event history models. Only internal moves in the later period and for certain social groups are associated with negative climate conditions, and the strength and direction of the observed effects change over time. International moves decrease with extreme rainfall, suggesting that the complex relationships between climate and migration that have been observed for contemporary populations extend into the nineteenth century.},

The central idea consists in estimating local projections at each period of interest rather than extrapolating into increasingly distant horizons from a given model, as it is done with vector autoregressions (VAR). The advantages of local projections are numerous: (1) they can be estimated by simple regression techniques with standard regression packages; (2) they are more robust to misspecification; (3) joint or point-wise analytic inference is simple; and (4) they easily accommodate experimentation with highly nonlinear and flexible specifications that may be impractical in a multivariate context. Therefore, these methods are a natural alternative to estimating impulse responses from VARs. Monte Carlo evidence and an application to a simple, closed-economy, new-Keynesian model clarify these numerous advantages.},

We also show that the marginal effects of temperature shocks vary across climates and income groups. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04~°C per year, in the absence of mitigation policies, reduces world real GDP per capita by more than 7 percent by 2100. On the other hand, abiding by the Paris Agreement goals, thereby limiting the temperature increase to 0.01~°C per annum, reduces the loss substantially to about 1 percent. These effects vary significantly across countries depending on the pace of temperature increases and variability of climate conditions. The estimated losses would increase to 13 percent globally if country-specific variability of climate conditions were to rise commensurate with annual temperature increases of 0.04~°C.},

Theoretical predictions and empirical studies suggest that risk taking may increase or decrease after experiencing shocks. So far the empirical evidence is sparse, especially when it comes to developed countries. We contribute to this literature by investigating whether experiencing financial and health-related damage caused by storms affects risk preferences of individuals in Germany. Using unique panel data, we find that household heads were more risk-seeking after they experienced storm damage. We do not find evidence of exposure to storm per se (regardless of damage experience), which suggests that household heads have to suffer damage for their risk preferences to be affected. These results are robust across a battery of alternative model specifications and alternative storm damage measures (magnitude of financial damage). We rule out other potential explanations such as health-related and economic shocks. The self-reported storm damage data is broadly confirmed by regional storm damage data provided by the insurance industry. While we cannot identify the channels through which experiencing storm damage affects risk preferences from our data, we suggest and discuss some potential channels. The results may have important policy implications as risk preferences affect, for instance, individuals’ savings and investment behaviour, adoption of self-protection and self-insurance strategies, and technology adoption. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

More specifically, the methodology integrates: (i) beach hazard as an expression of beach retreat calculation due to sea level rise to the extreme SSP5-8.5 scenario for 2050, (ii) beach exposure with regard to tourism economic losses according to the extent of beach touristic exploitation, and (iii) beach vulnerability with regard to both beach capacity considering its morphological characteristics and sensitivity considering the adverse impact of artificial structures and human development in the area. The results indicate a great heterogeneity in risk, with more than half beaches being at high or very high risk under the highest emissions scenario. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {This study assesses the short and medium-term impact of extreme temperatures on population health and health-related costs in Germany. For 1999 to 2008, we link the universe of 170 million hospital admissions and all 8 million deaths with weather and pollution data at the day-county level. Extreme heat significantly and immediately increases hospitalizations and deaths. This finding holds irrespective of whether we employ econometric models that are standard in economics or models that are standard in epidemiology; we compare and discuss both approaches. We find evidence for partial “harvesting.” At the end of a 30-day window, the immediate health effects are, on average, one quarter lower, but this reduction is primarily evident for cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases. Moreover, aggregating at the yearly level reduces the effect size by more than 90 percent. The health-related economic costs accumulate up to €5 million per 10 million population per hot day with maximum temperatures above 30\,°C (86\,°F).},

  abstract = {Problems of sustainability of water supply in tourist resorts are becoming an increasingly common and important issue in applied geography and environmental management. This paper examines the relationships between tourism and water supply on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, discussing both the scale of the problem and recent measures to find a solution, particularly the proposed Hydrological Plan for the Balearic Islands (published in 1998/9). Since Mallorca lies in an area likely to be seriously affected by future climate change, its potential effects are discussed and evaluated. One of the most critical problems relates to the coarse spatial resolution of general circulation models for predicting precipitation in an area where precipitation regimes grade steeply from semi-arid to humid temperate. However, it is likely that a continuation of the marked inter-annual and decadal-scale variability in precipitation seen during the recent past probably poses a greater threat to Mallorca's water supply than the more gradual, progressive change typically predicted to accompany future global warming. Similarly, continued over-exploitation of coastal aquifers will be more critical to water quality issues than the direct impacts of any future sea level rise, although the latter would undoubtedly exacerbate these effects. The conclusion discusses the controversial new ecotasa ('ecotax'), due to be imposed on Mallorca's tourist industry in 2002, which is likely to represent only a partial solution to the long-term water supply problem. As the physical, cultural and economic environments of Mallorca are typical of much of the Mediterranean region, the implications of this issue extend well beyond the island's shores. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The question for policy makers is whether the impacts of water-related risk accrue to manifest as a drag on economic growth at a scale suggesting policy intervention. In this study, the average drag on economic growth from water-related hazards faced by society at a global level is estimated. We use panel regressions with various specifications to investigate the relationship between economic growth and hydroclimatic variables at the country-river basin level. In doing so, we make use of surface water runoff variables never used before. The analysis of the climate variables shows that water availability and water hazards have significant effects on economic growth, providing further evidence beyond earlier studies finding that precipitation extremes were at least as important or likely more important than temperature effects. We then incorporate a broad set of variables representing the areas of infrastructure, institutions, and information to identify the characteristics of a region that determine its vulnerability to water-related risks. The results identify water scarcity, governance, and agricultural intensity as the most relevant measures affecting vulnerabilities to climate variability effects.},

The article first presents a conceptual framework for estimating the costs of climate change impacts. It then examines several approaches proposed in the literature that use historical weather data to econometrically estimate climate change impacts. These include cross section, linear and nonlinear panel methods, long differences, and partitioning variation. For each approach we describe the type of impacts (short-run versus long-run) estimated, the type of weather or climate variation used (e.g., cross-sectional, time-series, or a combination of the two using panel data), and the advantages and disadvantages of the approach. We conclude with a summary of our findings and priorities for future research.},

However, various fundamental elements of the economy are affected by deviations of daily temperature from seasonal expectations which are not well reflected in annual averages. Here we show that increases in seasonally adjusted day-to-day temperature variability reduce macro-economic growth independent of and in addition to changes in annual average temperature. Combining observed day-to-day temperature variability with subnational economic data for 1,537 regions worldwide over 40 years in fixed-effects panel models, we find that an extra degree of variability results in a five percentage-point reduction in regional growth rates on average. The impact of day-to-day variability is modulated by seasonal temperature difference and income, resulting in highest vulnerability in low-latitude, low-income regions (12 percentage-point reduction). These findings illuminate a new, global-impact channel in the climate–economy relationship that demands a more comprehensive assessment in both climate and integrated assessment models.},

Effects vary across seasons and regions depending on climatic norms, with further impacts from daily temperature variability and extreme precipitation.

This amounts to an average amplification of 21\% for climate-induced heat stress, river floods, and tropical cyclones. Modeling the temporal evolution of 1.8 million trade relations between 7000 regional economic sectors, we find that the regional responses to future extremes are strongly heterogeneous also in their resonance behavior. The induced effect on welfare varies between gains due to increased demand in some regions and losses due to demand or supply shortages in others. Within the current global supply network, the ripple resonance effect of extreme weather is strongest in high-income economies—an important effect to consider when evaluating past and future economic climate impacts.},

The Dystopian Schumpeter meeting Keynes (DSK) model is composed of heterogeneous firms belonging to capital-good, consumption-good and energy sectors. Production and energy generation lead to greenhouse gas emissions, which affect temperature dynamics. Climate damages are modelled at the individual level as stochastic shocks hitting workers' labour productivity, energy efficiency, capital stock and inventories of firms. In that, aggregate damages emerge from the aggregation of losses suffered by heterogeneous, interacting and boundedly rational agents. The model is run focusing on a business-as-usual carbon-intensive scenario consistent with a Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. We find that the DSK model is able to account for a wide ensemble of micro- and macro-empirical regularities concerning both economic and climate dynamics. Simulation experiments show a substantial lack of isomorphism between the effects of micro- and macro-level shocks, as it is typical in complex system models. In particular, different types of shocks have heterogeneous impact on output growth, unemployment rate, and the likelihood of economic crises, pointing to the importance of the different economic channel affected by the shock. Overall, we report much larger climate damages than those projected by standard IAMs under comparable scenarios, suggesting possible shifts in the growth dynamics, from a self-sustained pattern to stagnation and high volatility, and the need of urgent policy interventions.},

Although historical records indicate that economic shocks might lead to financial instability, few studies have focused on the impact of climate change on the financial actors5,6. This paper examines how climate-related damages impact the stability of the global banking system. We use an agent-based climate–macroeconomic model calibrated on stylized facts, future scenarios and climate impact functions7 affecting labour and capital. Our results indicate that climate change will increase the frequency of banking crises (26–248\%). Rescuing insolvent banks will cause an additional fiscal burden of approximately 5–15\% of gross domestic product per year and increase the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product by a factor of 2. We estimate that around 20\% of such effects are caused by the deterioration of banks’ balance sheets induced by climate change. Macroprudential regulation attenuates bailout costs, but only moderately. Our results show that leaving the financial system out of climate–economy integrated assessment may lead to an underestimation of climate impacts and that financial regulation can play a role in mitigating them.},

The methods are also tested against the benchmark by Girvan and Newman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 7821 (2002)] and on random graphs. As a result of our analysis, three recent algorithms introduced by Rosvall and Bergstrom [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 7327 (2007); Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 1118 (2008)], Blondel et al. [J. Stat. Mech.: Theory Exp. (2008), P10008], and Ronhovde and Nussinov [Phys. Rev. E 80, 016109 (2009)] have an excellent performance, with the additional advantage of low computational complexity, which enables one to analyze large systems.},

  abstract = {Background While some interactions between climate change and health have been well documented, the complex relationship between climate change, its proximate causes, and cancer is less clear. This scoping review was conducted to survey specific elements within existing peer-reviewed and grey literature addressing the impacts of climate change-related exposures on 1) cancer risks, 2) outcomes, and 3) care delivery. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, peer-reviewed and selected grey literature on these topics were identified using pre-specified eligibility criteria. Structured searches by independent reviewers and data extraction from multiple electronic databases were performed, from which syntheses were generated and research gaps identified. Results Of 542 studies identified by title/abstract for full-text review, 182 studies were eligible for data extraction. Of these, 127 examined fossil fuel-related pollutant levels and excess cancer risks, 29 investigated the impact of climate change on cancer outcomes, and 31 examined the impact of climate change-related events on cancer care delivery. Overall, the effects of climate change-related exposures, or climate change’s proximate causes, lead to increases in cancer risk. Climate change effects such as extreme weather events disrupt care and impact survival outcomes. Across these subject areas, climate change-related events’ exacerbation of existing healthcare disparities was an emergent theme. Conclusions Climate change has impacts across the cancer care continuum. Research gaps include limited data on the direct effect of climate change on cancer outcomes and care delivery, population health research, and mitigation efficacy. More work is needed in education, adaptation, and climate preparedness for cancer patients and healthcare systems.},

Given the importance of TFP for long-run economic growth, if true this would entail a substantial upward revision of current impact estimates. Using macro TFP data from a recently developed dataset in the Penn World Table, we test this hypothesis by directly examining the nature of the relationship between annual temperature shocks and TFP growth rates in the period 1960–2006. The results show a negative relationship only exists in poor countries, where a 1~°C annual increase in temperature decreases TFP growth rates by about 1.1–1.8 percentage points, whereas the impact is indistinguishable from zero in rich countries. Extrapolating from weather to climate, the possibility of dynamic effects of climate change in poor countries increases concerns over the distributional issues of future impacts and, from a policy perspective, restates the case for complementarity between climate policy and poverty reduction.},

  abstract = {Background Natural resource extraction projects can have positive but also negative effects on the health of affected communities, governed by demographic, economic, environmental, physical and social changes. Negative effects often prevail and these might widen existing health inequities. Health impact assessment (HIA) is a decision-support tool that aims at maximizing benefits and minimizing negative impacts on people's health. A core value of HIA is equity; yet, little is known about health equity in the frame of HIA, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Methodology We conducted a scoping review to determine whether and to what extent HIA in sub-Saharan Africa addresses health equity. We included peer-reviewed publications and guidelines pertaining to HIA, environmental impact assessment (EIA) and social impact assessment (SIA). Health equity was investigated by identifying (i) how health considerations were addressed and (ii) whether health was stratified by subgroups of the community. Results Out of 1′640 raw hits, we identified 62 articles (16 HIA, 36 EIA, one SIA and nine integrated assessments), 32 of which specifically addressed health. While 20 articles focused on a specific health topic, 12 articles used a more comprehensive approach to address health. In 15 articles there were specific subgroup analyses (e.g. mothers, children or marginalized groups) as a measure of health equity. Another 12 papers referred to the community in a more general way (e.g. affected). Without exception, health was an integral part of the nine included guidelines. HIA guidelines addressed health systematically through environmental health areas, risk assessment matrix or key performance indicators. Conclusions We found evidence that previously conducted HIA in sub-Saharan Africa and current guidelines address health equity. However, there is a need to stratify community subgroups more systematically in order to determine health differentials better. Future HIA should consider community heterogeneity in an effort to reduce health inequities by “leaving no one behind”, as suggested by the Sustainable Development Goals.},

Hot spots such as “biodiversity” and “climate change” have been emphasized in current EA research, a trend that will likely continue in the future. The h-index has been used to evaluate the research quality among countries all over the world, while the improvement of developing countries' EA systems is becoming a popular research topic.

The identification strategy uses historic regional data to exploit natural variation within each of two countries: one European country-Italy (1820-1962), and one Asian country-Japan (1671-1965). The choice of study settings allows consideration of Jones' (The European miracle, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1981) theory that preindustrial differences in income and population between Asia and Europe resulted from the fertility response to different environmental risk profiles. According to the results, short-run instability, particularly that arising from the natural environment, appears to be associated with a decrease in fertility-thereby suggesting that environmental shocks and economic volatility are associated with a decrease in investment in the population size of future generations. The results also show that, contrary to Jones' (The European miracle, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1981) theory, differences in fertility between Italy and Japan cannot be explained away by disaster proneness alone. Research on the effects of natural disasters may enable social scientists and environmentalists alike to better predict the potential effects of the increase in natural disasters that may result from global climate change. © 2010 The Author(s).},

To identify causal effects, a novel econometric strategy is employed, based on spatial first-differences. Economic activity is proxied by satellite data on nightlights. Drawing on climate science, the study distinguishes between temperature variability on three time scales: day-to-day, seasonal, and interannual variability. The results indicate that day-to-day temperature variability has a statistically significant, negative effect on economic activity, while seasonal variability has a smaller but also negative effect. The effect of interannual variability is positive at low temperatures, but negative at high temperatures. Furthermore, the results suggest that daily temperature levels have a non-linear effect on economic activity with an optimal temperature around 15 degrees Celsius. However, most of the estimated effects of variability cannot be explained with this non-linearity and instead seem to be due to larger uncertainty about future temperature realisations. The empirical effects can be found in both urban and rural areas, and they cannot be explained by the distribution of agriculture. The results indicate that projected changes of temperature variability might add to the costs of anthropogenic climate change especially in relatively warm and currently relatively poor regions.},

  abstract = {Climate change is projected to cause considerable pressure on our environment and communities. In particular, an increase in flooding and extreme erosion events is foreseeable as a result of an anticipated increase in the frequency and severity of storms. In the absence of timely and strategic intervention, climate change is taking us closer to more uncertain (non-linear, stochastic) and potentially more catastrophic climatic impacts. This paper develops a state-of-the-art modelling framework to assess the economic impact of erosion hazards on critical infrastructure and evaluate their vulnerability and resilience to differing storm regimes. This framework is trialled on a UK town (Cockermouth, NW England) that has experienced significant storm-related erosion and flood damage in recent years, highlighting its ability to determine current and future erosion hazard to critical infrastructure. A hydro-sedimentary model is used to simulate fluvial and hillslope sediment erosion and deposition caused by extreme storms within river catchments (sheet, rill, gully and channel bank and bed erosion). The model is applied for current climate conditions and for two future epochs (2021–2040 \& 2061–2080) to assess changing erosion hazard to critical infrastructure. Climate conditions for the two epochs are obtained using the UKCP18 high resolution realisation projections under emission scenario RCP8.5. The economic loss caused by these hazards is projected based on new, non-linear depth-cost curves derived from previous assessments. The results show that: 1) due to a warming climate, total rainfall in the Cockermouth area (and likely across the UK) may be higher for all storm durations and annual exceedance probabilities, until epoch 2061–2080 when the rainfall regime may shift towards shorter duration events with higher rainfall and longer duration events with less rainfall; 2) the total area that undergoes flooding, erosion and sediment deposition, and the magnitude of the hazard, may increase as the climate shifts; 3) the economic damage caused by erosion and deposition is positively related to rainfall total, and the highest costs are likely to be associated with damage caused to bridges (£102-130 million), followed by sediment deposition in the urban fabric (£9-82 million), and erosion damage to agricultural land (£16-26 million), buildings (£0.4-18 million) and roads (£0.4-4 million); and 4) the Estimated Annual Damage costs suggest that investment in bridges (£4-6 million) in the Cockermouth area is required now to ensure their resilience to extreme storm events, and interventions are likely to be needed within the next 20 years to prevent high economic costs associated with significant sediment deposition in the urban fabric (£0.3-4 million) and damage to roads (£0.08-0.1 million) and agricultural land (£0.6-2 million). This new framework can help support operational (immediate) and strategic (medium to long term i.e. 10+ years) erosion control decision making through the provision of an assessment of the scale and consequences of erosion. © 2021 The Authors},

  abstract = {Aside from climatic factors, the impact of heat waves on mortality depends on the demographic and socio-economic structure of the population as well as variables relating to local housing. Hence, this study’s main aim was to ascertain whether there might be a differential impact of heat waves on daily mortality by area of residence. The study is a time-series analysis (2000–2009) of daily mortality and minimum and maximum daily temperatures (°C) in five geographical areas of the Madrid region. The impact of such waves on heat-related mortality due to natural causes (ICD-10: A00- R99), circulatory causes (ICD-10: I00-I99) and respiratory causes (ICD-10: J00-J99) was obtained by calculating the relative risk (RR) and attributable risk (AR), using GLM models with the Poisson link and controlling for trend, seasonalities and the autoregressive nature of the series. Furthermore, we also evaluated other external variables, such as the percentage of the population aged over 65~years and the percentage of old housing. No heat-related mortality threshold temperature with statistical significance was detected in the northern and eastern areas. While the threshold temperatures in the central and southern areas were very similar and close to the 90th percentile, the threshold in the western area corresponded to the 97th percentile. Attributable mortality proved to be highest in the central area with 85 heat wave-related deaths per annum. External factors found to influence the impact of heat on mortality in Madrid were the size of the population aged over 65~years and the age of residential housing. Demographic structure and the percentage of old housing play a key role in modulating the impact of heat waves. This study concludes that the areas in which heat acts earliest are those having a higher degree of population ageing.},

In terms of results, an impact of cold on mortality was detected in 9 of the 17 districts analyzed. The analysis of risk patterns revealed that the probability of detecting an impact in a district increases in a statistically significant way (p-value {$<$}0.05) with a higher percentage of homes without heating systems and a higher percentage of population over age 65. The results obtained identify the factors that should be considered in public health policies that target the district level to reduce the impact of cold waves.},

  abstract = {While many studies analyze the effect of extreme thermal events on health, little has been written about the effects of extreme cold on mortality. This scarcity of papers is particularly relevant when we search studies about extreme cold on the health of rural population. Therefore, we tried to analyze the effect of cold waves on urban areas and rural areas from Madrid and to test whether differentiated effects exist between both population classes. For this purpose, we analyzed data from the municipalities with over 10,000 inhabitants for the period from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2013. Municipalities were classified as urban or rural (Eurostat), and they were grouped into similar climatological zones: Urban Metropolitan Centre (UMC), Rural Northern Mountains (RNM), Rural Centre (RC) and Southern Rural (SR). The dependent variable was the daily mortality rate due to natural causes per million inhabitants (CIE-X: A00-R99) that occurred between the months of November and March for the period. The independent variable was minimum daily temperature (ºC) (Tmin). Social and demographic contextual variables were used, including: population\,{$>$}\,age 64 (\%), deprivation index and housing indicators. The analysis was carried out in three phases: (1) determination of the threshold temperature (Tthreshold) which defines the cold waves; (2) determination of the relative risk (RR) for cold waves using Poisson linear regression (GLM); and (3) using GLM of the binomial family, Odds Ratios (OR) were calculated to analyze the relationship between the frequency of the appearance of cold waves and the socioeconomic variables.},

The objective of this study was to analyze the role of income level, percent of the population over age 65, existence of air conditioning units and hectares (Ha) of green zones in districts in Madrid, in the impact of heat on daily mortality between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. Seventeen districts were analyzed, and Generalized Linear (GLM) Poisson Regression Models were used to calculate relative risks (RR) and attributable risks (RA) for the impact of heat waves on mortality due to natural causes (CIEX:A00-R99). The pattern of risks obtained was analyzed using GLM univariates and multivariates of the binomial family (link logit), introducing the socioeconomic and demographic variables mentioned above. The results indicate that heat wave had an impact in only three of the districts analyzed. In the univariate models, all of the variables were statistically significant, but Ha of green zones lost significance in the multivariate model. Income level, existence of air conditioning units, and percent of the population over age 65 in the district remained as variables that modulate the impact of heat wave on daily mortality in the municipality of Madrid. Income level was the key variable that explained this behavior. The results obtained in this study show that there are factors at levels below the municipal level (district level) that should be considered as focus areas for health policy in order to decrease the impact of heat and promote the process of adaptation to heat in the context of climate change.},

  abstract = {Background The objective was to analyze whether there are differences in vulnerability to Extreme Cold Days (ECD) between rural and urban populations in Spain. Methodology Time series analysis carried out from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2013. Municipalities with over 10,000 inhabitants were included from 10 Spanish provinces, classified into 42 groups by isoclimate and urban/rural character as defined by Eurostat criteria. The statistical strategy was carried out in two phases. First: It was analyzed the relationship between minimum daily temperature (Tmin) (source: AEMET) and the rate of daily winter mortality due to natural causes —CIE-10: A00 – R99— (source: National Statistics Institute). Then, It was determinated the threshold of Tmin that defines the ECD and its percentile in the series of winter Tmin (Pthreshold), which is a measure of vulnerability to ECD so that the higher the percentile, the higher the vulnerability. Second: possible explanatory variables of vulnerability were explored using Mixed Generalized Models, using 13 independent variables related to meteorology, environment, socioeconomics, demographics and housing quality. Results The average Pthreshold was 18 \%. The final model indicated that for each percentage point increase in unemployment, the vulnerability to ECD increased by 0.4 (0.2, 0.6) points. Also, with each point increase in rurality index, this vulnerability decreased by −6.1 (−2.1, −10.0) points. Although less determinant, other factors that could contribute to explaining vulnerability at the province level included minimum winter daily temperatures and the percentage of housing with poor insulation. Conclusions The vulnerability to ECD was greater in urban zones than in rural zones. Socioeconomic status is a key to understanding how this vulnerability is distributed. These results suggest the need to implement public health prevention plans to address ECD at the state level. These plans should be based on threshold temperatures determined at the smallest scale possible.},

  abstract = {The objective of the article is to analyse the impact of short- and long-term climate variations on the costs of removing snow and ice from the roads in Bergen—the second most populous city in Norway. The analysis applies simple mathematics, Monte Carlo simulations and multivariate regression methodology. The municipality of Bergen manages about 630~km of roads and 100~km of foot and bicycle paths, and the municipal administration spends NOK 37 million (or about USD 4.5 million) annually on removing snow and ice during the winter period. The analysis shows that a 1~°C increase in the mean temperature reduces the winter maintenance costs by NOK 14 million, and it is likely that there will be no need for winter snow-clearing operations if the long-term mean atmospheric temperature increases by approximately 2.5~°C or more relative to the historical mean temperature level. The analysis shows that the variance and trend of the temperature have a strong effect on the likelihood of a snow- and ice-free winter and that a long-term reduction in the variance reduces the likelihood of rare events even though the mean temperature increases. The analysis provides the municipality of Bergen with information about the relationship between climate and winter road maintenance costs, and the statistical models can help to quantify the amount of economic and material resources needed for this purpose. The analysis is a contribution in the field of economic impact analysis of climate change on the transport sector.},

We show that, on average, warmer temperature shocks elicit a negative energy demand shift, exerting moderate deflationary pressure. By looking into several asymmetries and macroeconomic indicators, we rationalize that evidence as signaling that the “turn-off-heating” effect in Europe outweighs the “turn-on-cooling”. This result becomes clearer when energy market responses are decomposed into gas and electricity components. Weak inflationary effects from non-energy items are at play when the shock hits during warm seasons. A persistent inflationary tendency manifests when food and energy prices rise, an outcome emerging only when negative anomalies – cold spells – hit. These findings shed new light on monitoring price stability due to global warming.},

We examine the future development of potential loss of life due to flooding for a major flood prone area in The Netherlands. The analysis is based on projections and spatial distribution of population under a high economic growth scenario and a loss of life model. Results show that the projected population growth in flood prone areas is higher than average in the Netherlands between 2000 and 2040. Due to this effect the potential number of fatalities is projected to increase by 68\% on average for 10 different flood scenarios, not including impacts from climate change and sea level rise. Just sea level rise of 0.30 m leads to an average 20\% increase in the number of fatalities. The combined impact of sea level rise and population growth leads to an estimated doubling in the potential number of fatalities. Taking into account increasing probability of flooding due to sea level rise and extreme river discharges, the expected number of fatalities could quadruple by 2040. The presented results give a conservative and upper bound estimate of the increase of the risk level when no preventive measures are undertaken. It is found that the consideration of the exact spatial distribution of population growth is essential for arriving at reliable estimates of future risk of flooding. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides, the occurrence of climate events impedes economic progress––affecting economic readiness of climate mitigation. However, the effect of climatic factors on economic productivity has not been extensively covered in existing literature, especially among climate regimes. Here, we use sophisticated panel and time series techniques to examine the heterogeneous effects of temperature and emissions on income from 1960 to 2014. Our empirical results indicate a 1\% rise in temperature declines income by 0.39\% whereas 1\% increase in emission levels stimulates income by 0.22\%. This implies a mutual relationship between income and emissions––where environmental pollution supports wealth creation and vice versa. We find that a shift from optimal temperature levels to extreme patterns hamper economic productivity. Extreme temperatures affect heating and cooling degree days due to increased energy requirements, hence, escalating energy demand and emissions. With the agenda towards emission reduction, this study emphasizes economic structural change through transition from brown to green growth.},

  abstract = {The impact of climate change on human societies is now well recognised. However, little is known about how climate change alters health conditions over time. National level data around climate shocks and subsequent rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) could have relevance for resilience policy and programming. We hypothesise that climate shocks are associated with a higher national prevalence of IPV two years following a shock, and that this relationship persists for countries with different levels of economic development. We compiled national data for the prevalence of IPV from 363 nationally representative surveys from 1993 to 2019. These representative data from ever-partnered women defined IPV incidence as any past-year act of physical and/or sexual violence. We also compiled data from the Emergency Events Database (EM DAT) on the national frequency of eight climate shocks from 1920 to 2022 within 190 countries. Using exploratory factor analysis, we fit a three-factor latent variable composed of climate shock variables. We then fit a structural equation model from climate shocks (lagged by two years) and IPV incidence, controlling for (log) national gross domestic product (GDP). National data representing 156 countries suggest a significant relationship between IPV and a climate factor (Hydro-meteorological) composed of storms, landslides and floods (standardised estimate = 0·32; SE = 0·128; p = 0·012). GDP has a moderately large cross-sectional association with IPV (estimate = -0·529; SE = 0·047; p = 0·0001). Other climate shocks (Geological: earthquakes/volcanos; Atmospheric: wildfire/droughts/extreme temperature) had no measurable association with IPV. Model fit overall was satisfactory (RMSEA = 0·064 (95\%CI: 0·044–0·084); CFI = 0·91; SRMR = 0·063). Climate shocks have a longitudinal association with IPV incidence in global population-based data. This suggests an urgent need to address the higher prevalence of IPV likely to come about through climate shocks due to climate change. Our analysis offers one way policy makers could track national progress using existing data.},

  abstract = {Background Despite the relevance for occupational safety policies, the health effects of temperature on occupational injuries have been scarcely investigated. A nationwide epidemiological study was carried out to estimate the risk of injuries for workers exposed to extreme temperature and identify economic sectors and jobs most at risk. Materials and methods The daily time series of work-related injuries in the industrial and services sector from the Italian national workers' compensation authority (INAIL) were collected for each of the 8090 Italian municipalities in the period 2006–2010. Daily air temperatures with a 1\,×\,1\,km resolution derived from satellite land surface temperature data using mixed regression models were included. Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) were used to estimate the association between daily mean air temperature and injuries at municipal level. A meta-analysis was then carried out to retrieve national estimates. The relative risk (RR) and attributable cases of work-related injuries for an increase in mean temperature above the 75th percentile (heat) and for a decrease below the 25th percentile (cold) were estimated. Effect modification by gender, age, firm size, economic sector and job type were also assessed. Results The study considered 2,277,432 occupational injuries occurred in Italy in the period 2006–2010. There were significant effects for both heat and cold temperatures. The overall relative risks (RR) of occupational injury for heat and cold were 1.17 (95\% CI: 1.14–1.21) and 1.23 (95\% CI: 1.17–1.30), respectively. The number of occupational injuries attributable to temperatures above and below the thresholds was estimated to be 5211 per year. A higher risk of injury on hot days was found among males and young (age 15–34) workers occupied in small-medium size firms, while the opposite was observed on cold days. Construction workers showed the highest risk of injuries on hot days while fishing, transport, electricity, gas and water distribution workers did it on cold days. Conclusions Prevention of the occupational exposure to extreme temperatures is a concern for occupational health and safety policies, and will become a critical issue in future years considering climate change. Epidemiological studies may help identify vulnerable jobs, activities and workers in order to define prevention plans and training to reduce occupational exposure to extreme temperature and the risk of work-related injuries.},

For this purpose, we consulted the local press in Benidorm over the period 1969–2003. Using qualitative and quantitative geographical techniques, we found that the water supply in the area has managed to keep up with rapidly increasing demand, with only occasional imbalances and periods of crisis. We focused in particular on the causes and effects of the water supply crisis of 1978, a moment of great uncertainty in the history of Benidorm as a holiday resort. We also examined the influence of atmospheric conditions on precipitation levels and how these precipitation levels affect the water supply. Our results highlight the importance of intense rainfall episodes associated with easterly winds, which provided large inputs for Benidorm’s water supply system (Marina Baja Water Consortium). We also found that the water supply crisis of 1978 resulted in serious economic losses for Benidorm and damaged its image as a holiday destination and that the city is now less vulnerable to variations in the climate, as a result of its search for new water resources (both surface and ground water resources and from other nonconventional sources).},

  abstract = {Exposure to extreme ambient temperatures has been widely described to increase mortality. Exploring changes in susceptibility to temperatures over time can provide useful information for policy planning and can provide insights on the effectiveness of health preventive plans. The aims of this study were i) to compare changes in temperature-related mortality in Spain during a 20-year period and ii) to assess whether the number of actions implemented in each region as part of a Heat Health Prevention Plan (HHPP) was associated with the temporal changes in heat-related mortality. Daily counts of deaths and daily maximum temperature were obtained for each Spanish province (1993–2013). We used time-varying distributed lag non-linear models to estimate the relationship between temperature and mortality. We compared the risk of death due to extreme temperatures (cold and heat) in the two periods (1993–2002 and 2004–2013), assuming a constant temperature distribution and different temperature-mortality function. Results were reported as mortality attributable fraction (\%) (AF). Overall, there was a decrease in mortality attributable to temperature in period 2, more remarkable for extreme cold (from 1.01\% to 0.52\%), while for moderate heat there was an increase (from 0.38\% to 1.21\%). Provinces with more actions implemented in their HHPP showed stronger decreases in mortality attributable to extreme heat. Other variables (e.g. average temperature) could explain this association. The highest mortality-AF reductions were detected among the elderly, in mortality for cardiovascular causes and in towns with high socioeconomic vulnerability. Our results suggest that the implementation of the Spanish HHPP could help reduce heat-related mortality.},

  abstract = {Order picking has often been described as one of the most labor- and time-consuming internal logistics processes. In manual picker-to-parts order picking systems, order pickers often spend a significant amount of time on travelling through the warehouse to reach storage positions where required items are stored. To reduce the cost of order picking, researchers have developed various optimal and heuristic routing policies in the past. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of research on order picker routing. First, it identifies order picker routing policies in a systematic search of the literature and then develops a conceptual framework for categorizing the various policies. Order picker routing policies identified during the literature search are then descriptively analyzed and discussed in light of the developed framework. The paper also derives insights into the frequencies of usage of the different routing policies available in the literature and applies a citation analysis to identify seminal works that shaped the literature on order picker routing. The paper concludes with an outlook on future research opportunities.},

  abstract = {Adaptation to climate change in Europe has only recently become a true policy concern with the management of extreme events one priority item. Irrespective of future climatic changes increasing the need for systematic evaluation and management of extremes, weather-related disasters already today pose substantial burdens for households, businesses and governments. Research in the ADAM project identified substantial direct risks in terms of potential crop and asset losses due to combined drought and heatwave, as well as flood hazards in Southern and Eastern Europe, respectively. This paper focuses on the indirect, medium to longer term economic risks triggered by the direct risks and mediated by policy responses. We present a selection of three economic impact and adaptation assessments and modelling studies undertaken on extreme event adaptation in Europe. Responding to a need for more economically based adaptation assessments, we address some relatively unresearched issues such as the understanding of past adaptation, the role of market response to impacts as well as government's ability to plan for and share out extreme event risks. The first analysis undertakes an empirical exploration of observed impacts and adaptation in the agricultural sector in the UK comparing the impact of consecutive extreme events over time in order to determine whether adaptation has occurred in the past and whether this can be used to inform future estimates of adaptation rates. We find that farmers and the agricultural sector clearly have adapted to extreme events over time, but whether this rate can be maintained into the future is unclear, as some autonomous adaptation enacted seemed rather easy to be taken. Markets may mediate or amplify impacts and in the second analysis, we use an economic general equilibrium model to assess the economic effects of a reduction in agricultural production due to drought and heatwave risk in exposed regions in Spain. The analysis suggests that modelled losses to the local economy are more serious in a large-scale scenario when neighbouring provinces are also affected by drought and heatwave events. This is due to the supply-side induced price increase leading to some passing on of disaster costs to consumers. The simulation highlights the importance of paying particular attention to the spatial and distributional effects weather extremes and possibly changes therein induced by climate change may incur. Finally, we discuss how national governments may better plan their disaster liabilities resulting from a need to manage relief and reconstruction activities post event. We do so using a risk based economic planning model assessing the fiscal consequences associated with the coping with natural extremes. We identify large weather-related disaster contingent liabilities, particularly in the key flood hot spot countries Austria, Romania, and Hungary. Such substantial disaster liabilities ("hidden disaster deficits") when interacting with weak fiscal conditions may lead to substantial additional stress on government budgets and reduced fiscal space for funding other relevant public investment projects. Overall, our paper suggests the importance of respecting the specific spatial and temporal characteristics of extreme event risk when generating information on adaptation decisions. As our adaptation decisions considered, such as using sovereign risk financing instruments are associated with a rather short time horizon, the analysis largely focuses on the management of today's extreme events and does not discuss in detail projections of risks into a future with climate change. Such projections raise important issues of uncertainty, which in some instances may actually render future projections non-robust, a constraint to be kept in mind when addressing longer term decisions, which at the same time should account for both climate and also socioeconomic change. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The associated lock-downs caused local economic losses and the disruption of international supply chains. In addition, such stress alters the effects of short-term shocks as caused by climate extremes, especially their propagation through the economic network and the resulting repercussions. Here we show that adverse indirect impacts of tropical cyclones, river floods, and heat stress on global consumption are strongly enhanced when the economy is under stress. This compound effect results from aggravated scarcity causing higher consumer prices. Modeling climate impacts during Covid-19, we find that in a stressed economy with the current network structure, consumption losses due to climate extremes double in the USA and triple in China. The simulated effects intensify when climate shocks grow stronger. Our results emphasize the amplifying role of the interaction between climate change and its socioeconomic backdrop.},

However, the impacts of heat waves on economic output are not well captured by standard empirical approaches that ignore when hot days occur. Using a global dataset spanning 1979–2016, we show agricultural losses from past heat waves are up to an order of magnitude larger than suggested by standard approaches. Combining these estimates with a suite of climate models implies that by the end of the century, climate damages in agriculture may be 5–10~times larger than is predicted by a focus on mean temperature shifts alone. These findings have important implications for targeting and evaluating climate adaptation efforts.}

Key factors were the positive decadal trend in Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI), persistent La Niña conditions beginning in 2020, and the switch to El Niño in 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, the heating from EEI was over 75\% larger than during the onset of similar recent El Niño events. We show further how regional processes shaped distinct patterns of record-breaking sea surface temperatures in individual ocean basins. If the recent trend in EEI is maintained, we argue that natural fluctuations such as ENSO cycles will increasingly lead to amplified, record-breaking impacts, with 2023–2024 serving as a glimpse of future climate extremes.},

The next decade is crucial for determining the planet’s direction in ensuring that populations can adapt to climate change. This study aims to investigate the progress, challenges, opportunities, trends, and prospects of the SDGs through a bibliometric analysis from 2015 to 2022, providing insight into the evolution and maturity of scientific research in the field. The Web of Science core collection citation database was used for the bibliometric analysis, which was conducted using VOSviewer and RStudio. We analyzed 12,176 articles written in English to evaluate the present state of progress, as well as the challenges and opportunities surrounding the SDGs. This study utilized a variety of methods to identify research hotspots, including analysis of keywords, productive researchers, and journals. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive literature review by utilizing the Web of Science database. The results show that 31\% of SDG-related research productivity originates from the USA, China, and the UK, with an average citation per article of 15.06. A total of 45,345 authors around the world have contributed to the field of SDGs, and collaboration among authors is also quite high. The core research topics include SDGs, climate change, Agenda 2030, the circular economy, poverty, global health, governance, food security, sub-Saharan Africa, the Millennium Development Goals, universal health coverage, indicators, gender, and inequality. The insights gained from this analysis will be valuable for young researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and public officials as they seek to identify patterns and high-quality articles related to SDGs. By advancing our understanding of the subject, this research has the potential to inform and guide future efforts to promote sustainable development. The findings indicate a concentration of research and development on SDGs in developed countries rather than in developing and underdeveloped countries.},

Flood frequency is estimated as a function of river flows, extreme sea levels and estimated defence standards to determine the flood extent and depth. Flood consequences are estimated by combining the latter with information on urban areas, population density and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Climate and socio-economic scenarios and possible adaptation choices are included to analyse future conditions. In 2010, almost 6~\% of the European population is estimated to live in the 100~year flood area. The corresponding economic loss is €236 billion, assuming no defences. Estimated flood protection reduces economic damage substantially by 67 to 99~\% and the number of people flooded is reduced by 37 to 99~\% for the 100~year event. Impact simulations show that future climate and socio-economic conditions may increase flood impacts, especially in coastal areas due to sea-level rise. In contrast, impacts caused by fluvial flooding sometimes decrease, especially in southern and western regions of Europe due to decreases in precipitation and consequent run-off. Under high-end scenarios, flood impacts increase substantially unless there are corresponding adaptation efforts. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.}

  abstract = {In late March 2018, a large part of the Eastern Mediterranean experienced an extraordinary episode of African dust, one of the most intense in recent years, here referred to as the “Minoan Red” event. The episode mainly affected the Greek island of Crete, where the highest aerosol concentrations over the past 15 yeas were recorded, although impacts were also felt well beyond this core area. Our study fills a gap in dust research by assessing the multi-sectoral impacts of sand and dust storms and their socioeconomic implications. Specifically, we provide a multi-sectoral impact assessment of Crete during the occurrence of this exceptional African dust event. During the day of the occurrence of the maximum dust concentration in Crete, i.e. March 22nd, 2018, we identified impacts on meteorological conditions, agriculture, transport, energy, society (including closing of schools and cancellation of social events), and emergency response systems. As a result, the event led to a 3-fold increase in daily emergency responses compare to previous days associated with urban emergencies and wildfires, a 3.5-fold increase in hospital visits and admissions for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations and dyspnoea, a reduction of visibility causing aircraft traffic disruptions (eleven cancellations and seven delays), and a reduction of solar energy production. We estimate the cost of direct and indirect effects of the dust episode, considering the most affected socio-economic sectors (e.g. civil protection, aviation, health and solar energy production), to be between 3.4 and 3.8 million EUR for Crete. Since such desert dust transport episodes are natural, meteorology-driven and thus to a large extent unavoidable, we argue that the efficiency of actions to mitigate dust impacts depends on the accuracy of operational dust forecasting and the implementation of relevant early warning systems for social awareness. © 2022 The Authors},

We provide evidence on nonlinear and extreme weather effects on electricity prices. In all countries, reductions in temperature below a certain threshold increase electricity prices, yet these thresholds tend to be lower for colder countries than for warmer ones. In addition, warmer countries have an upper threshold above which temperatures also increase prices. The precipitation threshold is near the maximum for countries with limited hydroelectric generation and much lower for others with high hydropower capacity, such as Norway. Wind speed has a similar effect on electricity prices across countries, while irradiance has a statistically significant effect in countries with the highest solar capacity and higher average irradiance. Ultimately, the impact of weather conditions on electricity prices is influenced by a country's initial climatic conditions, generation mix, policies, energy efficiency levels, and behavioral factors. Policies aimed at reducing the disproportionately negative impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations should ideally be informed by accurate quantification of the impact of weather on electricity prices.},

  abstract = {In the race towards economic growth, increased pollutant emissions have spurred the rise in global surface temperatures, intensifying the process of climate change. While the existing literature on the economic impact of climate-related variables has looked at outcomes such as growth, income, fiscal response, and poverty, the effect of temperature shocks on inflation has largely been neglected. This paper is an attempt to fill this lacuna. Indeed, we analyze the dynamic impact of temperature shocks on inflation, a key policy variable of most central banks. We use a panel-VAR method with fixed-effects and a sample of developed and developing countries over the period 1961–2014. Our results suggest that temperature shocks lead to inflationary pressures. Worryingly, and for developing countries in particular, we find that these effects persist several years after the initial shock. Our finding remained unaltered by various robustness checks. We show that these effects pose a threat to monetary policy making. We argue that central banks should pay more attention to temperature shocks.},

Using a Vector Autoregression for a large cross-country panel, we identify the climate shock in the frequency domain as the shock that explains the bulk of the variance of climate variables in the long-run. An adverse climate shock is associated with an increase in measures of income inequality, affecting mostly low income households. The impact of the shock is larger in magnitude for low income, hot countries with a significant agricultural sector and low degree of adaptation to climate change.},

These effects expand across countries and industries through disruptions in supply chains. In this study, a method of identifying high-risk processes in the supply chain due to climate-related disasters is developed, along with climate-related disaster risk factors (CDRF) for each country and each type of climate-related disaster. As a case study, the automotive supply chains of the USA, China, Japan, and Germany were assessed using a multi-regional input-output table. The results show that, in the USA, Japanese, and German automotive industries, the climate-related disaster risk to workers outside the country is higher than that to workers within the country. However, the economic climate-related disaster risk is higher in the home country. In China's automotive industry, the risks to both workers and the economy were higher for the home country because the high level of involvement within the country. High-income countries should support climate change adaptation in low- and lower-middle income countries. These policies are also important for improving the stability of their own industrial base. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Past studies of the relationships between economic activity and geography have been hampered by limited spatial data on economic activity. The present study introduces data on global economic activity, the G-Econ database, which measures economic activity for all large countries, measured at a 1° latitude by 1° longitude scale. The methodologies for the study are described. Three applications of the data are investigated. First, the puzzling “climate-output reversal” is detected, whereby the relationship between temperature and output is negative when measured on a per capita basis and strongly positive on a per area basis. Second, the database allows better resolution of the impact of geographic attributes on African poverty, finding geography is an important source of income differences relative to high-income regions. Finally, we use the G-Econ data to provide estimates of the economic impact of greenhouse warming, with larger estimates of warming damages than past studies.}

In presenting a multi-scale assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerability in Norway, we show that the concept of vulnerability depends on the scale of analysis. Both exposure and the distribution of climate sensitive sectors vary greatly across scale. So do the underlying social and economic conditions that influence adaptive capacity. These findings question the common notion that climate change may be beneficial for Norway, and that the country can readily adapt to climate change. As scale differences are brought into consideration, vulnerability emerges within some regions, localities, and social groups. To cope with actual and potential changes in climate and climate variability, it will be necessary to acknowledge climate vulnerabilities at the regional and local levels, and to address them accordingly. This multi-scale assessment of impacts and vulnerability in Norway reinforces the importance of scale in global change research.},

We account for the intensity of exposure to extreme temperatures by analyzing the impacts of both single and consecutive days with extreme temperature, i.e., heat waves and cold spells, and examine several labor market channels behind those effects. We find that consecutive extremely hot days decrease regional GDP per capita but do not affect income inequality. Poor regions are affected by extreme temperatures relatively more than rich regions. These effects occur because of reallocation of labor from employment to unemployment, an increase in prices in poor regions, and to some extent because of changes in the industrial employment structure, while relative wages are not affected. Extremely cold days, both single and consecutive, as well as extreme precipitation have a limited impact on economic activity and income distribution.},

On the other hand, days with extremely cold temperature (below −30°C) may have an opposite impact and reduce mortality. Overall, our findings suggest that the economic costs of all-cause mortality due to one day with hot and cold temperatures correspond to 10.25 million USD and 7.91 million USD or 0.28\% and 0.22\% of daily GDP in Russia, respectively.

The results support the energy-environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for Spain, the continental, and Mediterranean zones. An N form is found for the Atlantic zone. The results also reflect that increases in temperature above 22∘C and decreases below 15∘C increase electricity consumption, this increase being progressive as temperatures vary. Thus, extreme temperature generates electricity consumption growth. The Mediterranean zone is most sensitive to these temperature changes. The results also show that electricity consumption is more sensitive to cold than to heat.

On the one hand, the European Union considers that it is necessary to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050; on the other hand, sectors need to adapt to a warming climate. Focusing on the tourism sector, and using panel data referring to 12 Spanish Mediterranean provinces and the 1999–2014 time period, this study tests the tourist stays and temperature effects on the electricity consumption of the hospitality sector by estimating extended Energy Environmental Kuznets curves for the sector. The results show that this curve is not supported. Instead, electricity consumption progressively increases as tourism grows. In addition, the results indicate that temperature variables have notable influence over electricity use, with a positive influence of global warming on electricity consumption. Finally, results also show positive relationships between overnight stays in hotels with higher star ratings and electricity use, while no significant price effects are observed. Electricity saving measures and renewable electricity generation promotion are recommended, especially in the highest energy consuming establishments.},

In the growing International Business (IB) research field, systematic literature reviews have great value, yet there are not many reviews published describing how researchers can design and develop classic review articles. In explaining the purpose, methodology, and structure of a systematic review, we provide guidelines for developing most insightful and useful review articles. By outlining steps and thumb rules to keep in mind, we present an overview of different types of review articles and explain how future researchers could potentially find them useful. In addition, we introduce nine articles finally selected for this special issue of systematic literature review-Looking back to look forward International Business research in the days to come.},

Our empirical analyses show that, on average, trading volumes fall significantly (between 4\% and 10\%) when maximum daily temperatures exceed 30~°C (86~°F). The observed negative association is remarkably robust to a battery of alternative analyses such as bin tests, event studies, and time-series regressions controlling for any seasonal effects and financial market conditions. From a theoretical perspective, this study contributes to the literature on behavioral finance by demonstrating the existence of a “hot weather” effect on financial markets.

Network capabilities have been deftly integrated, encompassing citation, collaboration and similarity analysis. Furthermore, the library incorporates AI capabilities, including embedding vectors, topic modeling, text summarization and other general natural language processing tasks, employing models such as sentence-BERT, BerTopic, BERT, chatGPT and PEGASUS.,As a demonstration, we have analyzed 184 documents associated with “multiple-criteria decision analysis” published between 1984 and 2023. The EDA emphasized a growing fascination with decision-making and fuzzy logic methodologies. Next, network analysis further accentuated the significance of central authors and intra-continental collaboration, identifying Canada and China as crucial collaboration hubs. Finally, AI analysis distinguished two primary topics and chatGPT’s preeminence in text summarization. It also proved to be an indispensable instrument for interpreting results, as our library enables researchers to pose inquiries to chatGPT regarding bibliometric outcomes. Even so, data homogeneity remains a daunting challenge due to database inconsistencies.,PyBibX is the first application integrating cutting-edge AI capabilities for analyzing scientific publications, enabling researchers to examine and interpret these outcomes more effectively. pyBibX is freely available at https://bit.ly/442wD5z.},

  abstract = {Reviews of primary research are becoming more common as evidence-based practice gains recognition as the benchmark for care, and the number of, and access to, primary research sources has grown. One of the newer review types is the ‘scoping review’. In general, scoping reviews are commonly used for ‘reconnaissance’ – to clarify working definitions and conceptual boundaries of a topic or field. Scoping reviews are therefore particularly useful when a body of literature has not yet been comprehensively reviewed, or exhibits a complex or heterogeneous nature not amenable to a more precise systematic review of the evidence. While scoping reviews may be conducted to determine the value and probable scope of a full systematic review, they may also be undertaken as exercises in and of themselves to summarize and disseminate research findings, to identify research gaps, and to make recommendations for the future research. This article briefly introduces the reader to scoping reviews, how they are different to systematic reviews, and why they might be conducted. The methodology and guidance for the conduct of systematic scoping reviews outlined below was developed by members of the Joanna Briggs Institute and members of five Joanna Briggs Collaborating Centres.},

It is a relatively new approach for which a universal study definition or definitive procedure has not been established. The purpose of this scoping review was to provide an overview of scoping reviews in the literature. Methods A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O'Malley framework. A search was conducted in four bibliographic databases and the gray literature to identify scoping review studies. Review selection and characterization were performed by two independent reviewers using pretested forms. Results The search identified 344 scoping reviews published from 1999 to October 2012. The reviews varied in terms of purpose, methodology, and detail of reporting. Nearly three-quarter of reviews (74.1\%) addressed a health topic. Study completion times varied from 2?weeks to 20?months, and 51\% utilized a published methodological framework. Quality assessment of included studies was infrequently performed (22.38\%). Conclusions Scoping reviews are a relatively new but increasingly common approach for mapping broad topics. Because of variability in their conduct, there is a need for their methodological standardization to ensure the utility and strength of evidence. ? 2014 The Authors.

  abstract = {Heatwaves are weather hazards that can influence societal and natural systems. Recently, heatwaves have increased in frequency, duration, and intensity, and this trend is projected to continue as a consequence of climate change. The study of heatwaves is hampered by the lack of a common definition, which limits comparability between studies. This applies in particular to the considered time scale for utilised metrics. Here, we study which durations of heatwaves are most impact-relevant for various types of impacts. For this purpose, we analyse societal metrics related to health (heat-related hospitalisations, mortality) and public attention (Google trends, news articles) in Germany. Country-averaged temperatures are calculated for the period of 2010-2019 and the warmest periods of all time scales between 1 and 90 days are selected. Then, we assess and compare the societal response during those periods to identify the heatwave durations with the most pronounced impacts. Note that these durations are based on average temperatures across the given time frame while individual days may be less warm. The results differ slightly between the considered societal metrics but indicate overall that heatwaves induce the strongest societal response at durations between 2 weeks and 2 months for Germany. Finally, we show that heatwave duration affects the societal response independent of, and additionally to, heatwave temperatures. This finding highlights the relevance of making informed choices on the considered time scale in heatwave analyses. The approach we introduce here can be extended to other societal indices, countries, and hazard types to reveal more meaningful definitions of climate extremes to guide future research on these events. © 2023 The Author(s).

Thus, aiming at assessing its vulnerability, this study includes a general characterization of climate variability in eight selected locations, both in northern and southern Bulgaria. Trend tests were applied to monthly precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature and to the Standardized Precipitation Index with two-month time step (SPI-2) relative to the period of 1951–2004. Negative trends were identified for precipitation and SPI-2 at various locations, mainly in the Thrace Plain, indicating that dryness is likely to be increasing in Bulgaria. The vulnerability of rainfed maize systems to drought was studied using the previously calibrated WinISAREG model and the Stewart’s yield model to compute both the relative yield decrease (RYD) due to water stress and the corresponding net irrigation required to overcome those losses. Results identified a strong relation between SPI-2 for July–August (SPI-2July–Aug) and RYD. Results also show that yield losses are higher when the soils have a smaller soil water holding capacity. For the various regions under study, thresholds for RYD were defined considering the related economic impacts and the influence of soil characteristics on the vulnerability of the rainfed maize systems. Finally, to support drought risk management, SPI-2July–Aug thresholds were developed to be used as indicators of the economic risk of rainfed maize for various climate regions and soil groups in Bulgaria. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

  abstract = {With increasing global urbanization and environmental threats, ensuring food security for poor city residents is a critical challenge. An ongoing debate is whether urban agriculture (UA) may serve as a pathway to food security for poor urban households. To assess this potential within low-income countries, we used standard systematic review procedures to synthesize findings from 35 peer-reviewed journal articles from 1980 to 2013 that presented data on UA and food security indicators. Though data quality was often lacking, several key findings emerged. Many of the reviewed studies found subsistence to be the primary motivation for practicing UA, followed by financial benefit, with UA substantially contributing to farming households’ food availability in some settings. Results regarding UA’s impact on dietary diversity reveal that in some farming systems UA may provide households with greater access to specific foods. Evidence also indicates that UA can be a key source of household income, though actual returns were low. Furthermore, results show that UA can facilitate women’s contribution to household food availability amid other household responsibilities, and can provide distinct benefits such as economic and social advancement. Although UA participation does not appear to fully eliminate pressure urban households face in obtaining food, a lack of supportive policies may constrain its potential. Municipal planning and agricultural policies that more effectively incorporate UA—and that integrate gender—may diminish barriers to productive UA practice. More rigorous research on UA’s contribution to food security in settings where supportive policies have been enacted would more clearly elucidate these linkages.},

  abstract = {Human activity affects the Earth's climate while itself being affected by climate change. To empirically estimate the impact of humanity onto climate and vice versa, climate econometrics has emerged as a field split into two strands: one side focusing on conditional models of the economic impact of climate change, taking climate as given. The other side empirically models climate, taking economic and human activity as given. However, economic and environmental systems are determined with feedback in both directions. Here I examine one way to reconcile the two strands of climate-econometric research by considering a full (albeit simple) empirical climate-economic system and the conditions under which the system can be studied by only looking at the conditional economic or climate side alone. Weak exogeneity is necessary for valid conditioning, strong exogeneity – required for conditional forecasting – lends itself to the concept of climate-takers and climate-setters (countries measurably affecting local climate), while super-exogeneity can be interpreted as policy invariance for the economic impact side, and as a ‘no-tipping point’ condition on the physical side. An application to a stylised climate-economic system using temperatures, SO2 emissions, and global forcing highlights how these concepts can be applied in practice. A system analysis in climate econometrics allows us to move towards fully-coupled empirical climate-economic models accounting for the necessary feedback to obtain empirical estimates of the impact of climate on humanity and vice versa.},

This literature scoping review aims to examine existing research on the impact of climate change on yield and income on the three agri-food value chains in Italy: viticulture, fruit and vegetables, and dairy cattle. By analysing the available literature, this study seeks to outline the pros and cons, knowledge gaps, and potential areas for future research. A systematic search of scientific databases was conducted to identify relevant articles published between 2000 and 2022. The search terms included climate change, agriculture, Italy, yield, income, and related keywords. Articles were screened based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in a final selection of studies. Quantitative information was collected and organized into descriptive tables.~The review encompassed 44 studies that investigated the impact of climate change on yield and income in various agricultural sectors across different regions of Italy. The findings indicate that climate change is already impacting crop productivity and income levels, with increased temperature, changes in precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events being identified as the primary drivers. Additionally, disparities were observed between different agricultural regions, crops, and farming systems, highlighting the need for location-specific and crop-specific assessments. The scoping review provides a prospective overview of the existing literature on climate change impacts on yield and income within the Italian agriculture system. It underscores the urgency for targeted adaptation strategies to minimize the negative consequences of climate change. Further research should focus on understanding the complex interactions between climate change, agricultural practices, socio-economic factors, and policy interventions to develop context-specific solutions for sustainable agriculture in Italy.},

Such an event would have direct impacts on economic activities located near the coastline and indirect impacts further inland. Using data from the DIVA model on sea floods, river floods, land loss, salinisation and forced migration, we analyse the effects of these damages in a computable general equilibrium model for 25 world regions. We consider three sea-level rise scenarios that correspond to 0.47, 1.12 and 1.75~m by the 2080s. By incorporating a wider range of damage categories, implemented in an economy-wide framework and including very rapid sea-level rise, the study offers a new contribution to climate change impact studies. We find that the loss of GDP worldwide is 0.5~\% in the highest sea-level rise scenario, with a loss of welfare (equivalent variation) of almost 2~\% world-wide. Within these aggregates, there are large regional disparities, with the Central Europe North region and parts of South-East Asia and South Asia being especially prone to high costs (welfare losses in the range of 4–12~\%). The analysis assumes that there is not public adaptation, which would substantially lower the costs. In this way, the analysis demonstrates what is at risk, and could be used to justify adaptation expenses. © 2015, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Flooding in the Yangtze River Basin could severely damage socio-economic development, river ecosystems, food security, hydropower production and transportation in China. The Yangtze River Basin accounts for approximately 30\% of China’s gross domestic product (GDP) and is an engine for the country’s rapid economic growth. One commonly held belief is that climate change has intensified extreme flood events, leading to increasing economic damage in the Yangtze River. Here, we quantitatively attributed economic exposure to climate change (i.e. climate-induced changes in weather-related events) and GDP growth, and assessed benefits, i.e. the reduction in economic exposure, from flood defence dikes of varying heights. To do this, we developed a framework by combing a large scale hydrological model, a hydraulic model, and long-term GDP data. We find that climate-induced changes in flood inundation area and resulted economic exposure were decreasing overall, whereas GDP growth drove the increases of potential economic exposure to floods. We also reveal that the basin average flood defence dikes should be at least approximately 3.5 m high to achieve an about ten-year average flood occurrence. Our results have significant policy and socioeconomic development implications.},

This investigation employs the wavelet-based quantile on quantile regression (QQR) approach to probe the comprehensive effects of southern oscillation (SOI) and geopolitical risk (GPR) on global supply chain pressure (GSCP) and further explore whether extreme climate and geopolitical risk disrupt the global supply chain. The empirical results suggest that SOI influences GSCP in different time scales, showing that extreme climate contributes to the deterioration of the global supply chain, where the La Nina events exert more influential and enduring effects than the El Nino phenomena. The positive influences from higher GPR to GSCP (except for the lowest level) in the short term indicate that geopolitical risk also disrupts the global supply chain, but this view is not held in relatively lower GPR and the medium- and long-run scenarios. By comparison, extreme climate brings more destructive effects on the global supply chain than geopolitical risk. Against the backdrop of severe climate challenges and intensifying Russia–Ukraine war, the conclusions provide valuable implications for stabilising the global supply chain and achieving sustainable development by preventing and defusing potential risks caused by climate disasters and geopolitical events.},

These production disruptions will change with future warming, impacting consumers locally as well as remotely through supply chains. Due to a potentially nonlinear economic response, trade impacts are difficult to quantify; empirical assessments rather focus on the direct inequality impacts of weather extremes. Here, simulating global economic interactions of profit-maximizing firms and utility-optimizing consumers, we assess risks to consumption resulting from weather-induced production disruptions along supply chains. Across countries, risks are highest for middle-income countries due to unfavourable trade dependence and seasonal climate exposure. We also find that risks increase in most countries under future climate change. Global warming increases consumer risks locally and through supply chains. However, high-income consumers face the greatest risk increase. Overall, risks are heterogeneous regarding income within and between countries, such that targeted local and global resilience building may reduce them.},

To progress in this direction, we present a systematic analysis of the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on SCs guided by a structured literature review that collated a unique set of publications. The literature review findings suggest that influenza was the most visible epidemic outbreak reported, and that optimization of resource allocation and distribution emerged as the most popular topic. The streamlining of the literature helps us to reveal several new research tensions and novel categorizations/classifications. Most centrally, we propose a framework for operations and supply chain management at the times of COVID-19 pandemic spanning six perspectives, i.e., adaptation, digitalization, preparedness, recovery, ripple effect, and sustainability. Utilizing the outcomes of our analysis, we tease out a series of open research questions that would not be observed otherwise.

In this region, summer mean temperatures have been reconstructed from tree-ring proxies, which provide annually resolved and millennium-long records of past climate. Here we show, using in-situ observations and two different tree-ring reconstructions, that summer 2024 was the warmest summer in 2000 years in northern Fennoscandia. Employing an attribution method based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models, we further estimate that climate change increased the likelihood of this extreme season by a factor of 93 (5–95\% uncertainty range 19–881) and increased the temperature an additional 2.1\,°C (1.4–2.8\,°C). Atmospheric circulation patterns influencing both summers 1937 and 2024 were largely similar, suggesting a comparable large-scale circulation influence. Our findings highlight the impact of climate change for the contemporary heat extremes in Fennoscandia, indicating that the warming of summer climate is emerging from its range of natural climate variability over the last two millennia.},

The sensitivity of zoo visitation to weather variability was seasonally dependent, so winter attendance is directly related to the frequency of dry, warm, calm, and cloudless days; in summer, attendance was less sensitive to weather, with visitors attending in largest numbers during mild, cloudy, and breezy days. Moreover, a dissociation exists between perception and behavior during the period of the largest influx of visitors: visitors remark the importance of weather when planning the activity, but they show little flexibility when visiting. Socio-economic factors (origin of visitors, family structure) fade the weather influence. © 2020, ISB.},

The translog distance function allows assessing interactions between different factors, and hence the influence of management on climate impacts. The Farm Accountancy Data Network provides extensive data on farm characteristics of farms throughout the EU15 (i.e. the 15 member states of the European Union before the extension in 2004). These data on farm inputs and outputs from 1990-2003 are coupled with climate data. As climate change is not the only change affecting European agriculture, we also include effects of subsidies and other changes on inputs and outputs of farms throughout Europe. We distinguish several regions and empirically assess (1) climate impacts on farm inputs and outputs in different regions and (2) interactions between inputs and other factors that contribute to the adaptation to these impacts. Changes in production can partly be related to climatic variability and change, but also subsidies and other developments (e.g. technology, markets) are important. Results show that impacts differ per region, and that 'actual impacts' cannot be explicitly separated into 'potential impacts' and 'adaptive capacity' as often proposed for vulnerability assessment. Farmers adapt their practices to prevailing conditions and continuously adapt to changing conditions. Therefore, 'potential impacts' will not be observed in practice, leaving it as a mainly theoretical concept. Factors that contribute to the adaptation also differ per region. In some regions more fertilizers or more irrigation can mitigate impacts, while in other regions this amplifies impacts. To project impacts of future climate change on agriculture, current farm management strategies and their influence on current production should be considered. This clearly asks for improved integration of biophysical and economic models. © 2008 The Author(s).},

Database searches were done in PubMed and Web of Science, as well as a reference list search. Studies were then selected in a systematic manner. The review includes 64 studies. Most studies made estimates using simulation methods, notably with Monte Carlo, Markov and system dynamics modelling. Inputs for the models such as transition probabilities and price elasticities were taken from census, register and survey data, evidence from previous (scientific) studies and sometimes outcomes from stakeholder participation. Of different health outcome measures, the number of deaths was most frequently used, followed by QALYs and DALYs and life years. Health effect distribution is frequently mentioned, but not often estimated. Scientific methodological publications on HIAs focusing on civil society initiatives are relatively sparse, indicating possibilities for further methodological advancement.

National income levels in origin and destination countries influence international migration. Emigration is relatively low not only from high income countries but also from very poor regions, which is explained in current migration theory by credit constraints and lower average education levels, among other reasons. These relationships suggest a potential non-linear, indirect effect of climate change on migration through this indirect channel. Here we explore this effect through a counterfactual analysis using observational data and a simple model of migration. We show that a world without climate change would have seen less migration during the past 30 years, but that this effect is strongly reduced due to inhibited mobility. Our framework suggests that migration within the Global South has been strongly reduced because these countries have seen less economic growth than they would have experienced without climate change. Importantly, climate change has impacted international migration in the richer and poorer parts of the world very differently. In the future, climate change may keep increasing global migration as it slows down countries’ transition across the middle-income range associated with the highest emigration rates.},

  abstract = {The majority of assessments of future heat-related health risk are based on projections of heat hazards superimposed solely on current socioeconomic conditions, thus neglecting the potential contribution of drivers of heat stress risk other than climate change. Partly to address this drawback, the climate change research community has developed a new scenario framework, made up of distinct sets of climate and socioeconomic scenarios. The few assessments of future heat-related health risk that have employed this new framework have focused on changes in population exposure but have often not accounted for future populations' vulnerability. In this paper, we combine European Shared Socioeconomic Pathways with Representative Concentration Pathways to provide spatially explicit European projections of heat-related health risk that account for multiple changes in both socioeconomic and climatic conditions. In doing so, we also address the challenge of accounting for projections of determinants of vulnerability under varying levels of socioeconomic development. Results reveal that the proportion of the European population at very high risk of heat stress will show a steady increase – from 0.4\% currently to 20.3\%, 32.6\%, or 48.4\% in 2050 depending on the scenario combination – unless substantial political changes occur rapidly and steadily shift the current socioeconomic development pathway towards sustainability. Ambitious mitigation policies associated with rapid technological progress to enhance human capital could also moderate future heat-related health challenges. Such challenges are unevenly spread across Europe, with the Mediterranean region and Scandinavia being respectively the most and the least impacted regions. Future heat-related health challenges are substantially influenced by varying levels of socioeconomic development, primarily through changes in vulnerability – changes in population exposure being only of secondary importance. The former may even have a more significant impact on future heat stress risk than climate change, particularly in the British Isles and in the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, there is an undeniable necessity to consider the future state of vulnerability – and its uncertainties under varying socioeconomic scenarios – when assessing future heat-related health challenges and designing health adaptation strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The assessment is based on two trajectories: (a) no adaptation, where the current levels of protection are kept constant, and (b) adaptation, where the level of protection is increased to defend against future flooding events. As a basis for our analysis we use an ensemble-based pan-European flood hazard assessment for present and future conditions. Socio-economic impacts are estimated by combining flood inundation maps with information on assets exposure and vulnerability. Ensemble-based results indicate that current expected annual population affected of ca. 200,000 is projected to increase up to 360,000 due to the effects of socio-economic development and climate change. Under the no adaptation trajectory current expected annual damages of €5.5. billion/year are projected to reach €98. billion/year by the 2080s due to the combined effects of socio-economic and climate change. Under the adaptation trajectory the avoided damages (benefits) amount to €53. billion/year by the 2080s. An analysis of the potential costs of adaptation associated with the increase in protection suggests that adaptation could be highly cost-effective. There is, however, a wide range around these central numbers reflecting the variability in projected climate. Analysis at the country level shows high damages, and by association high costs of adaptation, in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Romania, Hungary and Czech Republic. At the country level, there is an even wider range around these central values, thus, pointing to a need to consider climate uncertainty in formulating practical adaptation strategies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Spain being a country that encompasses so many different temperature zones, this work analyses EC per capita among the Autonomous Communities (AC) of Spain through a spatial-temporal decomposition analysis during the 2000–2016 period. The regional differences are explained by four decomposition factors: intensity, temperature, structural and per capita income. The temporal decomposition results show that temperature changes in Spain between 2000 and 2016 have substantially affected the per capita EC. Likewise, it has been noted that in the 2000–2008 period, the temperature effect mainly acted as an inhibitor compared to the 2008–2016 period, in which an increase in the days of extreme temperature acted as a driver. The spatial decomposition reveals that the structural and energy intensity effects contribute to the AC moving away from average figures, while the temperature and income effects contributes to reducing the differences depending on the location of the AC. The results enable to determine the importance of establishing public policy measures aimed at improving energy efficiency. © 2023, The Author(s).},

The results show that the negative effects of extreme temperatures on birth weight are amplified at higher energy prices, especially for mothers of lower socioeconomic status. By focusing on how energy prices moderate the impact of extreme temperatures on birth outcomes, opportunities arise for policy interventions aimed at reducing health inequalities at birth. Moreover, given the critical role that events in utero play in individuals’ later development, such policies have the potential not only to reduce health inequalities at birth, but also to address broader inequalities in long-term outcomes.},

Results show that years in which runoff is significantly lower than average, local economic activity growth is depressed. This impact is strongest in middle-income regions, where runoff 1 or 2 standard deviation below normal levels reduces GDP growth by 0.4–0.6\% and 1.3–2.5\%. I examine two mechanisms, agricultural production and hydropower dependence. Globally, agricultural production is depressed by below average runoff shocks, although the resulting impact on GDP is likely low. Regions which are more urban and rely more on hydropower production in their energy mix are significantly more sensitive to these runoff shocks. With climate change expected to increase the variability of water runoff, these shocks are expected to become more frequent in the future and in some regions may significantly hamper growth.},

This research aims to raise awareness and emphasise the need and potential of proactive measures to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. To do so, this article conducts a case study for a huge snowfall that occurred in the city of Madrid (Spain) in January 2021, blocking the city for several days. The analysis is based on geolocated big data sourced from Google Popular Times (GPT), which captures the occupancy of establishments throughout the city over the entire study period. An exploratory spatial-temporal analysis has been conducted to examine the impact of the snowfall on the daily activities of the city, taking into consideration the demographic characteristics. The findings reveal a distinction in the impact of the snowfall on activities. Essential activities experience less impact compared to leisure activities. Furthermore, at the socio-economic level, the impact on low-income neighbourhoods is observed to be less affected than on high-income neighbourhoods. The implications of this research contribute to the body of knowledge on climate change resilience and adaptation, providing valuable insights for urban management strategies and informing future research in this field. © 2023 The Authors},

Little is known, however, about cause-specific cardiovascular mortality, effect modification by air pollution and aircraft noise, and which population groups are the most vulnerable to extreme temperature. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study in Zurich, Switzerland, including all adult cardiovascular deaths between 2000 and 2015 with precise individual exposure estimates at home location. We estimated the risk of 24,884 cardiovascular deaths associated with heat and cold using distributed non-linear lag models. We investigated potential effect modification of temperature-related mortality by fine particles, nitrogen dioxide, and night-time aircraft noise and performed stratified analyses across individual and social characteristics. We found increased risk of mortality for heat (odds ratio OR = 1.28 [95\% confidence interval: 1.11–1.49] for 99th percentile of daily Tmean (24 °C) versus optimum temperature at 20 °C) and cold (OR = 1.15 [0.95–1.39], 5th percentile of daily Tmean (−3 °C) versus optimum temperature at 20 °C). Heat-related mortality was particularly strong for myocardial infarctions and hypertension related deaths, and among older women ({$>$}75 years). Analysis of effect modification also indicated that older women with lower socio-economic position and education are at higher risk for heat-related mortality. PM2.5 increased the risk of heat-related mortality for heart failure, but not all-cause cardiovascular mortality.

  abstract = {Extreme weather events frequently cause severe crop yield losses, affecting food security and farmers’ incomes. In this paper, we aim to provide a holistic assessment of these impacts across various extreme weather events and multiple crops. More specifically, we estimate and compare the impact of frost, heat, drought and waterlogging on yields of winter wheat, winter barley, winter rapeseed and grain maize production in Germany. We analyse 423,815 farm-level yield observations between 1995 and 2019, and account for extreme weather conditions within critical phenological phases. Furthermore, we monetarize historical yield losses due to extreme weather events on a spatially disaggregated level. We find that drought is a main driver for farm-level grain yield and monetary losses in German agriculture. For instance, a single drought day can reduce winter wheat yields by up to 0.36\%. It is estimated that during the period 1995–2019, summer drought led to yield losses in winter wheat, which, on average, caused annual revenues to sink by over 23 million Euro across Germany. We find that the impacts of extreme weather events vary considerably across space and time. For example, only the most important winter rapeseed production region in the North of Germany was prone to winter rapeseed yield losses due to heat during flowering. Moreover, waterlogging and frost are generally less relevant from an economic point of view, but can nevertheless cause crop- and regional-specific damage. Our analysis provides stakeholders with information for weather-related risk management and adaptation strategies.},

The impacts of climate change onto the regional enterprises are complex and differ sectorwise and according to geographical factors. In this paper, we take a differentiated look at climate change impacts and adaptation efforts in nine of the region's most affected sectors: agriculture, forestry \& wood processing, food \& beverage industries, water supply, logistics, winter tourism, manufacturing industries and the building sector. Framed by risk concepts we evaluate 157 interviews with company representatives and an additional online survey (n = 100) among small and medium-sized enterprises. The interviews and the online survey were carried out within the Interreg projects Clim'Ability and Clim'Ability Design during the years 2016–2021. We present an overview of sector-specific patterns of climate change impacts and adaptation efforts. Furthermore, we investigate the affected business units and fields of action for adaptation measures in a cross-sector perspective. Our results show that heat is the most relevant climatic stressor for a majority of the regional enterprises, followed by general warming and droughts. Extreme weather events like heavy rain, floods, thunderstorms or hail also play a considerable role, but adaptation to those phenomena appears to be less developed. This is an important starting point for future adaptation strategies and sector-specific recommendations for policy makers and local stakeholders. © 2023 The Author(s)},

  abstract = {Severe wind storms are one of the major natural hazards in the extratropics and inflict substantial economic damages and even casualties. Insured storm-related losses depend on (i) the frequency, nature and dynamics of storms, (ii) the vulnerability of the values at risk, (iii) the geographical distribution of these values, and (iv) the particular conditions of the risk transfer. It is thus of great importance to assess the impact of climate change on future storm losses. To this end, the current study employs-to our knowledge for the first time-a coupled approach, using output from high-resolution regional climate model scenarios for the European sector to drive an operational insurance loss model. An ensemble of coupled climate-damage scenarios is used to provide an estimate of the inherent uncertainties. Output of two state-of-the-art global climate models (HadAM3, ECHAM5) is used for present (1961-1990) and future climates (2071-2100, SRES A2 scenario). These serve as boundary data for two nested regional climate models with a sophisticated gust parametrizations (CLM, CHRM). For validation and calibration purposes, an additional simulation is undertaken with the CHRM driven by the ERA40 reanalysis. The operational insurance model (Swiss Re) uses a European-wide damage function, an average vulnerability curve for all risk types, and contains the actual value distribution of a complete European market portfolio. The coupling between climate and damage models is based on daily maxima of 10 m gust winds, and the strategy adopted consists of three main steps: (i) development and application of a pragmatic selection criterion to retrieve significant storm events, (ii) generation of a probabilistic event set using a Monte-Carlo approach in the hazard module of the insurance model, and (iii) calibration of the simulated annual expected losses with a historic loss data base. The climate models considered agree regarding an increase in the intensity of extreme storms in a band across central Europe (stretching from southern UK and northern France to Denmark, northern Germany into eastern Europe). This effect increases with event strength, and rare storms show the largest climate change sensitivity, but are also beset with the largest uncertainties. Wind gusts decrease over northern Scandinavia and Southern Europe. Highest intra-ensemble variability is simulated for Ireland, the UK, the Mediterranean, and parts of Eastern Europe. The resulting changes on European-wide losses over the 110-year period are positive for all layers and all model runs considered and amount to 44\% (annual expected loss), 23\% (10 years loss), 50\% (30 years loss), and 104\% (100 years loss). There is a disproportionate increase in losses for rare high-impact events. The changes result from increases in both severity and frequency of wind gusts. Considerable geographical variability of the expected losses exists, with Denmark and Germany experiencing the largest loss increases (116\% and 114\%, respectively). All countries considered except for Ireland (-22\%) experience some loss increases. Some ramifications of these results for the socio-economic sector are discussed, and future avenues for research are highlighted. The technique introduced in this study and its application to realistic market portfolios offer exciting prospects for future research on the impact of climate change that is relevant for policy makers, scientists and economists. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.}

The inflationary impacts of climate change have been commonly overlooked in the economic literature. As global temperatures rise and extreme weather events become more frequent and severe, the inflationary effects of climate change will only intensify. These effects could be further exacerbated by the considerable pricing power of the corporate sector. As a persistent inflationary driver, climate change poses a serious threat to central banks’ ability to maintain price stability mandates. The traditional tools of monetary policy will be ineffective in curbing climate change-induced price pressures. Further, growth-based Green New Deal and related fiscal policies will be ineffective at mitigating climate change and reducing its inflationary impacts. Unless degrowth solutions are sought, climate change and its price effects will only intensify over time.},

Objective: We surveyed government officials designated as Competent Bodies for Scientific Advice concerning infectious diseases to examine the degree to which they are concerned about potential effects of climate change on infectious diseases, as well as their perceptions of institutional capacities in their respective countries. Methods: In 2007 and 2009/2010, national infectious disease experts from 30 European Economic Area countries were surveyed about recent and projected infectious disease patterns in relation to climate change in their countries and the national capacity to cope with them. Results: A large majority of respondents agreed that climate change would affect vector-borne (86\% of country representatives), food-borne (70\%), water-borne (68\%), and rodent-borne (68\%) diseases in their countries. In addition, most indicated that institutional improvements are needed for ongoing surveillance programs (83\%), collaboration with the veterinary sector (69\%), management of animal disease outbreaks (66\%), national monitoring and control of climate-sensitive infectious diseases (64\%), health services during an infectious disease outbreak (61\%), and diagnostic support during an epidemic (54\%). Conclusions: Expert responses were generally consistent with the peer-reviewed literature regarding the relationship between climate change and vector- and water-borne diseases, but were less so for food-borne diseases. Shortcomings in institutional capacity to manage climate change vulnerability, identified in this assessment, should be addressed in impact, vulnerability, and adaptation assessments.}

Building policies in the EU have already addressed the resilience of buildings against possible hazards (i.e., natural disasters, extreme weathers, fires). However, with increasing overheating risks (e.g., climate change) accompanied by their detrimental health and economic impacts, the thermal performance of nearly zero energy buildings (nZEB) is not guaranteed. This study aims to assess the impact of shocks and combinations on the thermal resilience of educational nZEB against heatwaves (HW) and system shocks (SS) including failure of indirect evaporative cooling (IEC), natural night ventilation (NNV) and solar shading failure (SF). A Modelica model of the building was developed and experimentally validated. Shocks were classified and quantified using the novel normalized degree of shock (doS) index. Heatwaves (HWs) had 20 × to 93 × more critical impact than the worst SS (NNV failure). Additionally SS occurring at the start of the operational period is 1.2 × more critical than SS occurring later in the day as it allowed for significant heat build-up in both classrooms. In future climate scenarios a combination of HWs and power outages will become frequent. This study showed that a combination of a full day of cooling strategy and shading failure occurring on the hottest day of a 6-day long HW, is 10\% more critical on both lecture rooms than an individual 10-day long HW. Classroom with heavy thermal mass prolongs the absorptivity of the shocks but delays recovery. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {With the global climate change, heatwave events have become severe challenges to ecological system and human health. This study presents an integrated analysis and summary on the typical heatwave events since 2000, and elucidates the definitions and classifications of heatwaves, global trends in frequency and intensity, regional characteristics and their impacts on air pollution and human health. It reveals that the global frequency and intensity of heatwave events show an increasing trend. During heatwave events, temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and atmospheric circulation factors exert notable influences on ozone (O3), nitrogen-containing pollutants, and secondary particulate matter. O3 concentrations exhibit a positive correlation with temperature during heatwaves, however, the rate of increase slows down or is even suppressed under extreme high temperatures (O3 suppression). Heatwaves promoted the generation of nitrogen-containing pollutants, particularly reactive nitrogen through localized diffusion control, high temperatures, wildfires, and intense solar radiation. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation relies on the photochemical oxidation and heterogeneous-phase reaction, with the contribution of isoprene weakening and that of terpenes enhancing under high temperatures. Heatwaves influence nitrate and sulfate in different ways: the former tends to exist in gas phase due to high temperature, while the latter is influenced by the combined effects of temperature and humidity. During heatwaves, high temperatures and O3 exert extensive negative effects on human health resulting in risks of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, heatstroke and neurological abnormalities. Global society and local governments should pay more attention to the vulnerable populations such as the children, elders, pregnant women and low-income groups. More protective measures or policies related to extreme heatwaves should be formulated, such as establishing a high-temperature warning system, increasing green areas, providing high-temperature subsidies and relief funds.},

The findings show that 24.09\% of the global extreme climate events have a significant impact on natural gas ARs, with the cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) reaching their peak on the eighth day after the event. There is heterogeneity in the patterns of the impacts of extreme climate events on CARs. Among them, the impacts of storms are strongest, the impacts of extreme temperatures have the longest duration, the responses of CARs to wildfires are the earliest, and the responses to floods with high damage and high-peak CARs have the largest differences in trends. In terms of the regions of extreme climate events, the responses of CARs are most rapid to events in the Americas, are strongest to events in Europe, and are most moderate to events in Asia. Compared with events occurring in non-major gas-producing countries, events occurring in major gas-producing countries have greater influences. We also find that the impact of extreme climate events on the natural gas market is deepening over time. Finally, the study finds that factors concerning fundamental, speculative, climatic, and event attributes have significant impacts on peak CARs.},

The nonlinear results present some evidence of heterogeneous responses of wealth inequality to climate risk variable shocks between high- and low-climate risk regimes. The findings highlight the disproportionate increased burden of climate change on households that are already experiencing poverty, particularly households in high-climate risk areas. As such, measures to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change need to be tailored so as not to overburden the poor.},

In a national panel of Indian factories, annual plant output falls by about 2\% per degree Celsius. This response appears to be driven by a reduction in the output elasticity of labor. Our estimates are large enough to explain previously observed output losses in cross-country panels.}

  abstract = {Wind and solar power have experienced rapid cost declines and are being deployed at scale. However, their output variability remains a key problem for managing electricity systems, and the implications of multi-day to multi-year variability are still poorly understood. As other energy-using sectors are electrified, the shape and variability of electricity demand will also change. We develop an open framework for quantifying the impacts of weather on electricity supply and demand using the Renewables.ninja and DESSTINEE models. We demonstrate this using a case study of Britain using National Grid's Two Degrees scenario forwards to 2030. We find the British electricity system is rapidly moving into unprecedented territory, with peak demand rising above 70 GW due to electric heating, and intermittent renewable output exceeding demand as early as 2021. Hourly ramp-rates widen by 50\% and year-to-year variability increases by 80\%, showing why future power system studies must consider multiple years of data, and the influence of weather on both supply and demand. Our framework is globally applicable, and allows detailed scenarios of hourly electricity supply and demand to be explored using only limited input data such as annual quantities from government scenarios or broader energy systems models. © 2017 The Authors},

  abstract = {Since 2006, a number of countries developed reports on climate change following the IPCC 4th assessment reports. For the Netherlands, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) presented four new climate scenarios. Typically, climate change is described in terms of average changes, but much of the social and economic costs associated with climate change in the built environment will result from shifts in the frequency and severity of extreme events. In this study, the consequences of the climate change scenarios on the design wind speeds used in building regulations are discussed. Based on the best actual available knowledge of climate change models, the effect of climate change implies a change of -0.8\% to +2.3\% in the hourly mean wind speed with return period of 50 years, which is the basis of current building codes. To confirm the outcomes, further development of climate change scenarios is needed with more focus on extreme events with large return periods and small time scales. Natural variability of wind speed appears to have a great effect on wind trends for extreme wind velocities, and when adapting values for extreme climatic effects in building codes, both climate change effects and effects of natural variability should be considered. The analysis as presented for extreme wind speeds can be applied to other domains, such as thermal and precipitation where extreme values of climatic conditions define building design, and can therefore serve as general framework to assess extreme events. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Most studies have focused on large-scale climate migration events triggered by extreme weather events such as droughts, storms, or floods. But there are few studies of how climate change, interacting with background social, economic, and political processes, shapes the everyday household-level experience of water insecurity and subsequent migration decision-making beyond the contexts of disasters and agricultural livelihoods—an invisible ‘slow drip’ of migration. This review proposes a complementary, alternative framework for linking climate change, household-level water insecurity, and environmental migration by positioning household water insecurity as a critical pathway for shaping migration decision-making in the context of socio-environmental change. We present evidence that household water insecurity is a push factor that motivates household members to migrate due to water-related disruptions to physical and mental health, livelihoods beyond agriculture, and social relationships. We close with implications for anti-poverty and development initiatives, and for water interventions to mitigate forced climate migration.},

The study is distinguished by its breadth of coverage, for it includes tertiary sectors and activities. Although impacts in tertiary activities are often not included in assessments of the potential impacts of climatic change, many of these activities are very important to the U.K. economy, and therefore even a small perturbation in output due to a weather extreme can have significant implications for the economy as a whole. The activities and sectors studied include energy consumption, retailing and manufacturing, construction and buildings, tourism, health, human behaviour, and fires. Both negative and positive impacts were incurred within most sectors. Net positive impacts (to the general public) were found convincingly for energy consumption and health, and clear negative impacts for buildings insurance and fires. Sectors which show clear differences in their response to winter and summer warm anomalies are energy consumption, tourism and health (greater sensitivity to winter anomalies) and buildings insurance and fires (greater sensitivity to summer anomalies). Changes in sensitivity to climate extremes may have occurred over time, and a comparison of impacts of the 1995 anomalous weather with the unusually warm dry period of 1975-1976 is approached for several series.}

We searched seven bibliographic databases to identify peer-reviewed studies, and grey literature was identified through a series of targeted searches on databases that included EVRI, Google Scholar, Social Value UK, New Economics Foundation, and OpenGrey. Study quality was assessed using adapted versions of the Drummond checklist and Krlev's quality assessment framework. Forty five eligible studies were included in the analysis; most were of medium quality (n~=~27), and a large proportion (n~=~22) used cost-benefit analysis. We observed inconsistencies in relation to the selection of benefits, use of discount rates, and sensitivity analysis, as well as a general lack of stakeholder input. Further, we identified a range of different instruments and evaluation techniques, but no clearly defined methodological framework that studies adhered to. Greater consensus is needed on the application of methodologies used to value UGBS interventions if evaluations are to remain credible and inform future investments.},

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes “long term” simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere–ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These “decadal predictions” are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive. For researchers unfamiliar with climate models, the limitations of the models and experiment design are described.},

Results show that generally, AF is not able to compete with agricultural land use but there are notable exceptions. Especially improved policy conditions and internalising environmental externalities can make AF competitive. Compared to forestry AF is generally able to achieve better economic outcomes. The economic performance is, in addition to ecosystem service payments and policy support, dependent on soil and site characteristic, as well as prices and the profitability of the individual system components. Intensive management and increased knowledge of these systems also increase competitiveness. There are various research gaps such as economic risk on farm- and plot-level, economic performance of AF under future climate change, or a comparison of different sustainability enhancing measures in agriculture.},

  abstract = {The daily relationship of electricity and gas demand with temperature in Great Britain is analysed from 1975 to 2013 and 1996 to 2013 respectively. The annual mean and annual cycle amplitude of electricity demand exhibit low frequency variability. This low frequency variability is thought to be predominantly driven by socio-economic changes rather than temperature variation. Once this variability is removed, both daily electricity and gas demand have a strong anti-correlation with temperature (r elec = -0.90 , r gas = -0.94). However these correlations are inflated by the changing demand-temperature relationship during spring and autumn. Once the annual cycles of temperature and demand are removed, the correlations are and . Winter then has the strongest demand-temperature relationship, during which a 1 °C reduction in daily temperature typically gives a ~1\% increase in daily electricity demand and a 3\%-4\% increase in gas demand. Extreme demand periods are assessed using detrended daily temperature observations from 1772. The 1 in 20 year peak day electricity and gas demand estimates are, respectively, 15\% (range 14\%-16\%) and 46\% (range 44\%-49\%) above their average winter day demand during the last decade. The risk of demand exceeding recent extreme events, such as during the winter of 2009/2010, is also quantified. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {I review the literature on the economic impacts of climate change, an externality that is unprecedentedly large, complex, and uncertain. Only 14 estimates of the total damage cost of climate change have been published, a research effort that is in sharp contrast to the urgency of the public debate and the proposed expenditure on greenhouse gas emission reduction. These estimates show that climate change initially improves economic welfare. However, these benefits are sunk. Impacts would be predominantly negative later in the century. Global average impacts would be comparable to the welfare loss of a few percent of income, but substantially higher in poor countries. Still, the impact of climate change over a century is comparable to economic growth over a few years. There are over 200 estimates of the marginal damage cost of carbon dioxide emissions. The uncertainty about the social cost of carbon is large and right-skewed. For a standard discount rate, the expected value is \$50/tC, which is much lower than the price of carbon in the European Union but much higher than the price of carbon elsewhere. Current estimates of the damage costs of climate change are incomplete, with positive and negative biases. Most important among the missing impacts are the indirect effects of climate change on economic development; large-scale biodiversity loss; low-probability, high-impact scenarios; the impact of climate change on violent conflict; and the impacts of climate change beyond 2100. From a welfare perspective, the impact of climate change is problematic because population is endogenous, and because policy analyses should separate impatience, risk aversion, and inequity aversion between and within countries.},

The former studies posit that climate change has a permanent effect on economic growth, the latter that the effect is transient. The impact on economic growth implied by studies of the impact of climate change is close to the growth impact estimated as a function of weather shocks. The social cost of carbon shows a similar pattern to the total impact estimates, but with more emphasis on the impacts of moderate warming in the near and medium term.},

This work aims to assess the most relevant aspects of this episode. This includes describing the associated meteorological conditions and key hydrological characterisation such as the level of exceptionality of the observed precipitation at different temporal scales, or the estimation of peak discharge values in 20 small river catchments affected. Additionally, from a human impact perspective we provide a full account of all the main socio-economic impacts, particularly the numbers and location of victims (dead, injured, homeless and evacuated). Based on the sub-daily time series of a representative station, and its Intensity–Duration–Frequency curves, we have found that the exceptionality of this rainfall event is particularly linked to rainfall intensities ranging in duration from 4 to 9 h compatible with return periods of 100-years or more. This range of time scale which are similar to the estimated concentration time values of the hydrographic basins affected by the flash flood event. From a meteorological perspective, this episode was characterised by strong convection at the regional scale, fuelled by high availability of moisture over the Lisbon region associated with a low pressure system centered near Lisbon that favoured the convective instability. Most victims were sleeping or were caught by surprise at home in the small river catchments around the main Lisbon metropolitan area. The majority of people who died or who were severely affected by the flood lived in degraded housing conditions often raised in a clandestine way, occupying flood plains near the stream beds. This level of destruction observed at the time is in stark contrast to what was observed in subsequent episodes of similar amplitude. In particular, since 1967 the Lisbon area, was struck by two comparable intense precipitation events in 1983 and 2008 but generating considerably fewer deaths and evacuated people. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Using a sample of 21 European countries from 2001 to 2020, we find that firms exposed to greater climate change experience higher debt costs. The impact is even more extreme when using climate-related opportunity and regulatory exposure measures. We further find critical economic channels through which the higher debt costs occur: financial development and credit supplies. Specifically, our findings hold only for firms in weakly developed financial markets and institutions as measured by the new broad-based multi-dimensional financial development indices. We also find some other conditioning factors. Firstly, the higher the carbon intensity level, the greater the debt cost a firm with more climate change exposure must pay. Secondly, debtholders appear to punish firms with high environmental and social disclosure that are exposed to more climate change. Thirdly, the findings are more pronounced in financially constrained firms. © 2024 The Authors},

  abstract = {Climate has historically played a critical role in the development of nations, primarily due to its intrinsic linkage with agricultural production and prices. This study examines one such relationship between the better known and most talked about climate anomaly, El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the international prices of wheat, one of the most produced and consumed grain cereals in the world. The ENSO–price relationship, moreover, is assumed to be characterized by nonlinear dynamics, because of the known asymmetric nature of ENSO cycles, as well as that of wheat prices. This study applies a vector smooth transition autoregressive (VSTAR) modeling framework to monthly spot prices of wheat from the United States, the European Union, Australia, Canada, and Argentina, as well as the sea surface temperature anomalies from the Nino3.4 region, which serves as a proxy for the ENSO variable. Results show that, overall, wheat prices tend to increase after La Niña events, and decrease after El Niño events. The regime-dependent dynamics are apparent with more amplified price responses after La Niña shocks, and with more persistent price responses during the La Niña conditions. This is consistent with the economics of storage, wherein shocks related to expected supply and demand are known to have a more pronounced effect in a low-inventory regime. Findings of this study have strong implications for development economics, as they point to an additional channel of adversity due to the ENSO-related climate shocks. Moreover, the ENSO-induced price fluctuations are likely to affect the dynamics of international food and cash programs during extreme episodes of this climate anomaly.},

While the yield effect is predominantly observed in strongly teleconnected countries, it is amplified in lower income countries, which we attribute to possible lack of resilience to ENSO—induced weather shocks. Both El Niño-like and La Niña-like conditions result in maize yield reduction, but it is during El Niño events when maize yields drop by up to 20\% in most affected countries. Because in many of these countries maize is an important agricultural crop, the presented results are of interest to researchers and policy makers in the areas of world nutrition and international aid. Moreover, because larger share of maize is produced by high income weakly teleconnected countries, the observed geographic heterogeneity of the El Niño impact offers possible benefits from global risk sharing. These findings also offer insights to climate change economics, as possible increased frequency of the ENSO cycle may negatively impact maize production in strongly teleconnected low income countries.},

The objective with this article is to evaluate the evidence on public health benefits of exposure to natural environments and explore how this knowledge could be framed within the NBS concept. We conducted a systematic review of reviews following established methodology, including keyword search in several databases, predefined inclusion criteria, and a data extraction in accordance with the PICOS structure. We reviewed literature on associations between public health and natural environments in relation to pathways – sociobehavioural/cultural ecosystem services (e.g. stress and physical activity) and regulating ecosystem services (e.g. heat reduction) – or defined health outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular mortality). The results show that there is strong evidence for improved affect as well as on heat reduction from urban natural environments. These conditions may mediate the effect seen on cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related mortality by exposure to natural environments. By also reviewing existing literature on NBS and health, we phrase the results within the NBS context, providing guidelines on how public health and well-being could be integrated into implementation of NBS for resilient and liveable urban landscapes and health in a changing climate.},

Of 15 review articles on the economic impacts of climate change published since 2010, only three mention the impacts of climate change on education. We review available literature on the effects of weather extremes on education. We outline key pathways through which these events impact education outcomes, as well as the magnitude of those impacts. Evidence implies a significant and adverse relationship between heat and learning. Studies suggest surpassing a high temperature threshold makes learning difficult and results in learning losses. Across studies, each additional day subject to extreme heat reduces learning. Tropical cyclones, floods, and wildfires precipitate school closures, which halt learning. Evidence suggests that one day of school closures leads to one day of learning lost. Weather extremes also negatively impact education outcomes through health, nutrition, poverty, and fragility, among other distal pathways. We discuss the implications of this evidence for policy, including the need to adapt education systems to climate change. Mitigation and adaptation are both urgently needed as extreme weather events become more frequent and severe in the context of climate change. © 2024 International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank.},

Few cities have managed to prevent spatial and social inequality despite sustainable development strategies like compact city planning. We explore whether environmental injustice exists in a city where one would least expect to find it: a city with abundant nature, an affluent population governed by a left leaning social democratic city council, and an aggressive densification strategy; Oslo, Norway. Green space was measured with a satellite-derived vegetation index which captures the combined availability of gardens, street trees, parks and forest. Blue space was defined by the proximity of residential areas to the closest lake, river or fjord. We found that poorer city districts, often with greater immigrant populations, have less available blue-green spaces and are disproportionately exposed to hazardous air pollution levels, but not extreme heat compared to wealthier city districts. Citizens living within 100 m of a water body are likely to earn US\$ 20,000 more per year than citizens living 500 m away from water, and a US\$ 3000 increase in annual income corresponds to a 10 \% increase in green space availability. Hazardous air pollution concentrations in the poorest city districts were above levels recommended by the WHO and Oslo municipality. Historical trends showed that districts undergoing population densification coincide with the lowest availability of blue-green space, suggesting that environmental justice has been overlooked in compact city planning policy. Despite Oslo's affluence and egalitarian ideals, the patterns of inequality we observed mirror the city's historical east-west class divide and point to spatial concentration of wealth as a core factor to consider in studies of green segregation. Urban greening initiatives in Oslo and other cities should not take spatial equality for granted, and instead consider socio-economic geographies in their planning process. © 2022 The Authors},

  abstract = {Background Extensive evidence links both cold and hot temperatures to an increased incidence of occupational injuries. Contextual modifiers of the temperature-injury association have been scarcely researched. The present study addresses temporal and spatial variations to identify factors associated with (mal)adaptation to heat and cold among Spanish workers. Methods We assessed the association between daily mean temperature and work injuries using quasi-Poisson time-series regression models in 48 Spanish provinces over the period 1988–2019, with comparative analyses with census and economic data for the sub-periods 1989–1993, 1999–2003, 2009–2013 and 2015–2019. We explored the spatial and spatiotemporal modification of the association by demographic and socioeconomic variables via cross-sectional and longitudinal meta-regressions. Findings: We found an increased risk of work-injuries by 4~\% [95~\% CI: 3~\%-6 \%] and 12~\% [95~\% CI: 10~\%-13~\%], for the 1st and 99th percentiles of temperature, respectively, for period 1988–2019. Heat had a greater overall impact than cold, and the groups more vulnerable to heat were male workers, under 35~years, and working in agriculture, construction and hostelry. Vulnerability to heat was highest in the earliest sub-period, while vulnerability to cold rose during periods of both economic expansion and recession. High educational attainment emerged as a protective factor during the warm months in the cross-sectional meta-regressions. Conclusions Our findings suggest an adaptation of Spanish workers to high temperatures over time. However, preventive measures are needed for traditionally exposed workers (agriculture and construction), non-traditionally vulnerable sectors (hostelry), and young, male, and less educated workers during warm months. For cold vulnerability, targeted measures should focus on women, the elderly, and tertiary service workers, especially in colder regions. Addressing temperature vulnerability would enhance worker safety, reduce injuries, and yield economic benefits.},

  abstract = {Inland shipping is a key modality for freight transport between the seaport of Rotterdam and the industrial areas in Germany and Switzerland. The recent droughts of 2018, 2019 and 2022 have clearly demonstrated how discharge related supply chain disruptions cause substantial economic damages in the hinterland. The IPCC predicts that climate change will increase the variability in water cycles globally, making future extremes more frequent and more severe. In-depth insight into the response of inland shipping to discharge extremes is crucial to better anticipate and potentially mitigate this climate risk. Existing literature takes (a small number of) representative vessels and estimates corridor scale climate risks through extrapolation. Recent droughts have shown that this approach may give unrealistic results. Newspaper articles and reports from the sector suggest that the fleet composition and vessel deployment change during high and low discharge extremes, and cascading effects are likely to occur. So far, however, no objective data on this phenomenon has been reported in literature. This paper analyses ten years of IVS and discharge data, for the period between 2010 and 2020, revealing in detail for the first time how discharge levels and vessel deployment are related. This improved insight into shipping response is crucial for any corridor to accurately estimate the climate risk of discharge extremes. While this paper focuses on the Rhine corridor, the proposed method is applicable to other corridors as well. © 2023 The Author(s)},

  abstract = {Disasters such as floods, storms, heatwaves and droughts can have enormous implications for health, the environment and economic development. In this article, we address the question of how climate change might have influenced the impact of weather-related disasters. This relation is not straightforward, since disaster burden is not influenced by weather and climate events alone—other drivers are growth in population and wealth, and changes in vulnerability. We normalized disaster impacts, analyzed trends in the data and compared them with trends in extreme weather and climate events and vulnerability, following a 3 by 4 by 3 set-up, with three disaster burden categories, four regions and three extreme weather event categories. The trends in normalized disaster impacts show large differences between regions and weather event categories. Despite these variations, our overall conclusion is that the increasing exposure of people and economic assets is the major cause of increasing trends in disaster impacts. This holds for long-term trends in economic losses as well as the number of people affected. We also found similar, though more qualitative, results for the number of people killed; in all three cases, the role played by climate change cannot be excluded. Furthermore, we found that trends in historic vulnerability tend to be stable over time, despite adaptation measures taken by countries. Based on these findings, we derived disaster impact projections for the coming decades. We argue that projections beyond 2030 are too uncertain, not only due to unknown changes in vulnerability, but also due to increasing non-stationarities in normalization relations.},

For the considered impacts, welfare decreases by 0.37\% to 1.37\% in 2060 relative to a reference without CC. Higher summer temperatures increase mortality and decrease productivity.

Hence, there is an increasing need for global-scale flood risk assessments, also within the context of integrated global assessments. We have developed and validated a model cascade for producing global flood risk maps, based on numerous flood return-periods. Validation results indicate that the model simulates interannual fluctuations in flood impacts well. The cascade involves: hydrological and hydraulic modelling; extreme value statistics; inundation modelling; flood impact modelling; and estimating annual expected impacts. The initial results estimate global impacts for several indicators, for example annual expected exposed population (169 million); and annual expected exposed GDP (1383 billion). These results are relatively insensitive to the extreme value distribution employed to estimate low frequency flood volumes. However, they are extremely sensitive to the assumed flood protection standard; developing a database of such standards should be a research priority. Also, results are sensitive to the use of two different climate forcing datasets. The impact model can easily accommodate new, user-defined, impact indicators. We envisage several applications, for example: identifying risk hotspots; calculating macro-scale risk for the insurance industry and large companies; and assessing potential benefits (and costs) of adaptation measures.},

There exists, however, conflicting evidence for greater economic losses despite well acknowledged increases in the severity of observed extreme events in recent decades. Here, using a worldwide catastrophe insurance database from 1970 to 2015, we link the catastrophe economic loss from extreme storms and floods to local temperature. We find a statistically significant positive association between economic losses expressed as a proportion of GDP and local temperature. The association between economic losses and temperature is greater as the event becomes more extreme, with the signal muted for flooding as compared to storms. Although local associations of economic loss with temperature cannot be directly linked to rising global temperatures as a result of climate change, the positive economic loss-temperature associations are consistent with observed extreme precipitation-temperature associations, and hence pertinent to the advancement of understanding future natural catastrophes.},

Most of these effects are assumed to be biological – including poor nutrition during critical windows of fetal development, or through increased maternal stress. However, in addition to these biological effects, climatic conditions at the time of conception may also cause changes in parental behavior, not only affecting the mix of parents who conceive, but also the characteristics of the children once born. This paper explores whether increases in ambient temperature at the time of conception, while in utero, or after birth affect educational and health outcomes as adults. Using Census and Demographic and Health Survey data from sub-Saharan Africa, we show that individuals conceived during high temperatures have higher educational attainment and literacy. In addition, we find evidence of temperature effects at other times in utero, especially during the first trimester. We then explore the biological and behavioral mechanisms through which this effect may occur, including heat-induced changes in sexual behavior, differences in parental characteristics, and intensified fetal selection. We conclude that fetal selection is the most likely mechanism driving our result.},

A large body of literature has identified the detrimental effects of climate change on crop yields worldwide, and farm-level adaptation has been shown to mitigate the adverse effects on agricultural production. In this study, we employ a structural model to examine farm production responses to ongoing weather trends. We investigate how farmers adjust output and input decisions by estimating a system of output supply and input demand functions, controlling for nonrandom crop selection. Using panel data with 14,796 observations reflecting 1638 German crop farms (1996–2019), we find that both the expected and realized weather determine farmers' production decisions. In the event of a drought, the supply of most considered crops and the demand for fertilizer decrease. The drought shock has also lasting effects on farmers' production decisions, with a reduced supply of protein crops and an increased level of root crops production in subsequent years. These findings highlight the need to account for farm-level production responses when assessing weather and climate impacts.},

Historically, database searches have been the norm, which was later complemented with snowball searches. Our conjecture is that we can perform even better searches if combining these two search approaches, referred to as a hybrid search strategy. Objective: Our main objective was to compare and evaluate a hybrid search strategy. Furthermore, we compared four alternative hybrid search strategies to assess whether we could identify more cost-efficient ways of searching for relevant primary studies. Methods: To compare and evaluate the hybrid search strategy, we replicated the search procedure in a systematic literature review (SLR) on industry–academia collaboration in software engineering. The SLR used a more “traditional” approach to searching for relevant articles for an SLR, while our replication was executed using a hybrid search strategy. Results: In our evaluation, the hybrid search strategy was superior in identifying relevant primary studies. It identified 30\% more primary studies and even more studies when focusing only on peer-reviewed articles. To embrace individual viewpoints when assessing research articles and minimise the risk of missing primary studies, we introduced two new concepts, wild cards and borderline articles, when performing systematic literature studies. Conclusions: The hybrid search strategy is a strong contender for being used when performing systematic literature studies. Furthermore, alternative hybrid search strategies may be viable if selected wisely in relation to the start set for snowballing. Finally, the two new concepts were judged as essential to cater for different individual judgements and to minimise the risk of excluding primary studies that ought to be included.},

This review provides insights not previously fully captured or evaluated by other reviews on this topic, including key authors, key journals and the prestige of the reviewed papers. Using rigorous bibliometric and visualisation tools, we identified four research clusters, including deteriorating inventory models under trade credit policy based on the EOQ/EPQ model; inventory decisions with trade credit policy under more complex situations; interaction between replenishment decisions and delay payment strategies in the supply chain and roles of financing service in the supply chain. Based on the clusters identified, we carried out a further content analysis of 112 papers, identifying research gaps and proposing seven actionable directions for future research.

  abstract = {Climate change may have major influences on surface runoff, which would consequently result in important implications for terrestrial ecosystems and human well-being. At global scale there is limited understanding of these issues with respect to the warming targets stipulated in the Paris Agreement. Here we use a well-established hydrological model (Variable Infiltration Capacity [VIC]) forced with a representative ensemble of latest climate projections from four global circulation models (GCMs) to estimate potential future changes in runoff and Terrestrial Ecosystem Water Retention (TEWR), as well as changes in extreme runoff and their impacts on population, and overall gross domestic product (GDP) worldwide. Results suggest that annual runoff generally would have larger increases, while annual TEWR generally would have larger decreases under the 2.0°C warming scenario as opposed to 1.5°C warming scenario. Global mean warming of 2°C versus 1.5°C would lead to more distinct spatial patterns in runoff change, with a general shift of the runoff distribution towards more extreme low runoff in Mexico, western United States, Western Europe, southeastern China, West Siberian Plain and more extreme high runoff in Alaska, northern Canada, and large parts of Asia. More people and GDP would be exposed to extreme low runoff decrease, extreme high runoff increase, extreme low runoff decrease as well as extreme high runoff increase under a higher warming scenario. This study differentiates hydrological impacts between the two warming scenarios and illustrates higher runoff, lower TEWR, larger potential drought and flood hazards and adverse impacts on population and GDP under 2°C than 1.5°C. ©2020.

By introducing three climate risk measures—the climate policy uncertainty index, climate physical risk index, and climate concern index—the empirical results reveal the vulnerability of European electricity markets to volatile climate policies and extreme climate crisis events. Overall, the spillover effects in the climate–electricity nexus are primarily concentrated in the medium- and long-term frequency domains, indicating that the impact of climate risk shocks is persistent. Compared with the impact of climate physical risks and climate concern shocks, the spillovers from climate policy uncertainty shocks to the electricity market are higher and more persistent. These findings highlight the need to consider the heterogeneous impacts of climate risks on electricity markets at different frequency bands. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The extreme weather caused by global warming is increasing day by day. It is of great significance to reasonably assess the risk from extreme precipitation in the world to reduce the losses caused by disasters. Based on the daily precipitation simulation data of 22 global climate models (GCMs) under three scenarios, shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) 1–2.6, 2–4.5, and 5–8.5 in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), this study calculated three rainstorm indicators (annual rainstorm days, ARDs; annual rainstorm intensity, ARI; and annual rainstorm maximum, ARM), combined them into an index to indicate rainstorm hazard, calculated the socioeconomic exposure index using the projected future population and GDP data of SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3, and finally combined the rainstorm hazard index and socioeconomic exposure index to calculate the socioeconomic risk index of rainstorms. The socioeconomic risks from rainstorms in different periods (1995–2014, 2041–2060, and 2081–2100) were compared at global and continental scales. The main factors that cause the differences in the socioeconomic risks from rainstorms on different continents were explored. The uncertainties of the three rainstorm indicators calculated from the 22 GCMs were analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The socioeconomic risk from rainstorms in most regions of the world will increase in the future, with the largest increase in the SSP5-8.5 scenario and the smallest increase in the SSP1-2.6 scenario. Compared with the historical period, the number of grids with increased risk in the mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100) is 97.58\% and 97.98\% under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, respectively. Under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the number of grids with increased risk in the mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100) is 89.20\% and 86.57\%, respectively. (2) Overall, in the two future periods, the least socioeconomic risk from rainstorms is in Europe, and the largest socioeconomic risk from rainstorms is in Asia, especially the southern and southeastern parts of Asia, which have both the highest mean socioeconomic risk and the largest growth of socioeconomic risk. (3) The socioeconomic risk changes of rainstorms in North and South America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania are more closely related to socioeconomic exposure changes, while the socioeconomic risk changes of rainstorms in Europe are more closely related to the three rainstorm indicators. (4) Among the three scenarios, the SSP5-8.5 scenario has the largest uncertainty, and among the three rainstorm indicators, ARDs have the largest uncertainty. The regions with the greatest uncertainty are concentrated in central North America, Central America, central and southern Africa, central South America, eastern Asia, and southern Oceania. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {With rising extreme weather events due to climate change, the impact on agricultural production has become increasingly severe. Yet, there has been a significant gap in research that assesses the influence of day-to-day temperature variability on agricultural productivity on a global scale. Our study addresses this gap by exploring the effects of day-to-day temperature variability and the change of rainfall patterns on agricultural productivity worldwide from 1961 to 2018. The results reveal that day-to-day temperature variability not only has a direct, negative impact on agricultural total factor productivity (TFP), but also influences it by modulating the effects of monthly average temperatures and wet days. One unit increase of day-to-day temperature variability leads to a 2\% decrease in TFP. Day-to-day temperature variability neutralizes the impact of monthly average temperature on TFP, while exacerbating the impact of wet days on TFP. Furthermore, extreme rainfall events result in a consistent negative marginal effect across all countries/seasons/rainfall intervals. This study also identifies differentiated impacts across countries with varying income levels. Low-income regions’ TFP demonstrates markedly significant sensitivities to both monthly average temperatures and daily temperature fluctuations, which means less resilient. Furthermore, the impacts of general and extreme rainfall are comparatively less pronounced in high-income countries, indicating higher resilience to climate variability in these regions and a relative vulnerability to extreme weather events in low-income regions. Our findings illuminate the intricate and multifaceted role that daily temperature variability plays in agricultural productivity, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the heterogeneous impacts of climate change on agriculture and contributing insights into the broader discourse on climate resilience and agricultural sustainability.},
