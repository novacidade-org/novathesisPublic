  abstract = {This paper demonstrates that the conditional negative binomial model for panel data, proposed by Hausman, Hall, and Griliches (1984), is not a true fixed–effects method. This method—which has been implemented in both Stata and LIMDEP—does not in fact control for all stable covariates. Three alternative methods are explored. A negative multinomial model yields the same estimator as the conditional Poisson estimator and hence does not provide any additional leverage for dealing with overdispersion. On the other hand, a simulation study yields good results from applying an unconditional negative binomial regression estimator with dummy variables to represent the fixed effects. There is no evidence for any incidental parameters bias in the coefficients, and downward bias in the standard error estimates can be easily and effectively corrected using the deviance statistic. Finally, an approximate conditional method is found to perform at about the same level as the unconditional estimator.},

  abstract = {Traffic accidents significantly impact public health and economy through injuries, fatalities, and property damage. Effective emergency response planning requires sophisticated risk prediction tools with precise spatial and temporal resolution. While previous studies have assessed accident risk, they typically employed coarse spatial grids that lack the street-level detail crucial for emergency operations. This research presents a novel two-stage gradient-boosting predictive model, using tree-based learning algorithms to analyze traffic accidents requiring firefighter intervention in Lisbon, Portugal. To address the inherently unbalanced nature of accident data, we developed a sequential approach: first, a classification model identifies locations with non-zero accident probability; second, a regression model quantifies accident probabilities at street level across different time periods. The resulting risk simulator enables emergency planners to recalculate accident probabilities when street characteristics or weather conditions change, providing actionable insights for resource allocation and response planning. This research contributes both methodologically, through its innovative handling of spatially imbalanced data, and practically, by delivering an operational tool that supports evidence-based emergency service management. Validation results demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in predicting high-risk locations and times, allowing for proactive deployment of emergency resources.},

  abstract = {Traffic managers strive to have the most accurate information on road conditions, normally by using sensors and cameras, to act effectively in response to incidents. The prevalence of crowdsourced traffic information that has become available to traffic managers brings hope and yet raises important questions about the proper strategy for allocating resources to monitoring methods. Although many researchers have indicated the potential value in crowdsourced data, it is crucial to quantitatively explore its validity and coverage as a new source of data. This research studied crowdsourced data from a smartphone navigation application called Waze to identify the characteristics of this social sensor and provide a comparison with some of the common sources of data in traffic management. Moreover, this work quantifies the potential additional coverage that Waze can provide to existing sources of the advanced traffic management system (ATMS). One year of Waze data was compared with the recorded incidents in the Iowa’s ATMS in the same timeframe. Overall, the findings indicated that the crowdsourced data stream from Waze is an invaluable source of information for traffic monitoring with broad coverage (covering 43.2\% of ATMS crash and congestion reports), timely reporting (on average 9.8 minutes earlier than a probe-based alternative), and reasonable geographic accuracy. Waze reports currently make significant contributions to incident detection and were found to have potential for further complementing the ATMS coverage of traffic conditions. In addition to these findings, the crowdsourced data evaluation procedure in this work provides researchers with a flexible framework for data evaluation.},

  abstract = {Inclement weather creates a chronic hazard for Canadian travellers. Past studies indicate that road collision rates increase during precipitation, although the magnitude of theincrease varies from study to study, partly as a result of variations in weather and driving conditions,but also because of differences in methods. The goal of the current study is to improve ourunderstanding of the links between weather and travel risk in mid-sized Canadian cities by using astandardized method for analyzing data from six cities with different climates: Halifax-Dartmouth,Ottawa, Québec, Hamilton, Waterloo Region, and Regina. The study has four interrelated objectives: (1) Toconduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the extent to which risk estimates vary depending onthe criteria used to define precipitation events and `normal' conditions; (2) To compare therelative risk of collision and injury during precipitation relative to `normal' conditions; (3) Todetermine the extent to which weather-related risks vary fordifferent Canadian cities; and (4) To explore any differences in collision characteristics between events and controls, especially as theyvary from city to city. Results are based on a matched-pair analysis, using six-hour time blocks over afour-year period, 1995 to 1998. Results indicate only modest sensitivity to the criteria used to define precipitation events and `normal' conditions. On average, precipitation is associated with a 75 percentincrease in traffic collisions and a 45 percent increase in related injuries, as compared to `normal'seasonal conditions, but risk levels vary depending on the characteristics of the weather event.Both sensitivity to specific weather conditions and weather-related accident profiles vary from city tocity in ways that are not easily explained.},

  abstract = {Although the correlation between traffic variables and weather appears to be intuitive, quantifying the effects that weather, especially rain, has on driver response in travel speeds and traffic demands is needed to evaluate practical aspects of traffic operations. Previous studies have researched driver responses to inclement weather on freeways located in northern regions of the United States and Canada. However, driver familiarity with local weather conditions is a factor that should be considered in determining inclement weather effects on traffic variables. The focus of this research was to examine driver response to rain precipitation on freeways located in the southeastern regions of the United States to determine whether results from previous studies were general indicators or location specific in nature. To study the impacts of rain precipitation on hourly mean speeds and traffic volumes, hourly weather data and traffic sensor data were collected for two freeway segments in Jacksonville, Florida. The study investigated conditions such as wet versus dry (rain or no rain) and dry versus rain intensity (no rain or light, moderate, or heavy rain) for each segment. The results indicated that mean travel speeds decreased during rainfall events and speed reductions increased with increasing rain intensity. Reductions found for light rainfall events were within the range of previous studies; however, speed reductions during moderate to heavy rains varied widely. The results also indicated that the hour of the day was a factor in the degree of motorists’ speed reduction. Traffic volumes also declined during rainy conditions, with significant reductions during peak hours.},

  abstract = {BackgroundExperimental studies have shown a decrease in driving performance at high temperatures. The epidemiological evidence for the relationship between heat and motor vehicle crashes is not consistent.ObjectivesWe estimated the impact of high ambient temperatures on the daily number of motor vehicle crashes and, in particular, on crashes involving driver performance factors (namely distractions, driver error, fatigue, or sleepiness).MethodsWe performed a time-series analysis linking daily counts of motor vehicle crashes and daily temperature or occurrence of heat waves while controlling for temporal trends. All motor vehicle crashes with victims that occurred during the warm period of the years 2000–2011 in Catalonia (Spain) were included. Temperature data were obtained from 66 weather stations covering the region. Poisson regression models adjusted for precipitation, day of the week, month, year, and holiday periods were fitted to quantify the associations.ResultsThe study included 118,489 motor vehicle crashes (an average of 64.1 per day). The estimated risk of crashes significantly increased by 2.9\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.7\%, 5.1\%] during heat wave days, and this association was stronger (7.7\%, 95\% CI: 1.2\%, 14.6\%) when restricted to crashes with driver performance–associated factors. The estimated risk of crashes with driver performance factors significantly increased by 1.1\% (95\% CI: 0.1\%, 2.1\%) for each 1°C increase in maximum temperature.ConclusionsMotor vehicle crashes involving driver performance–associated factors were increased in association with heat waves and increasing temperature.

It also integrates a fixed-point acceleration method to hasten the convergence of the fixed-effect coefficients. The R function offers the user a simple way to estimate any of four different maximum likelihood models: Poisson, Negative Binomial, Gaussian and Logit. Illustrations with real data detail the estimation process as well as the clustering of standard-errors and the various tools to export and manage results from multiple estimations. Simulations show that the algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of computing time (often by orders of magnitude) or, in the Gaussian case, is on a par with the most efficient ones. Most interestingly, apart from the Gaussian case, the algorithm is revealed to be the only able to estimate models with many fixed-effects on a simple laptop.

It is based on some case studies carried out in Work Package 7 on “Data analysis and synthesis” of the EU-FP6 project “SafetyNet – Building the European Road Safety Observatory”, which illustrate the use of weather variables for analysing changes in the number of road injury accidents. Time series analysis models with explanatory variables that measure the weather quantitatively were used and applied to aggregate datasets of injury accidents for France, the Netherlands and the Athens region, over periods of more than 20 years. The main results reveal significant correlations on a monthly basis between weather variables and the aggregate number of injury accidents, but the magnitude and even the sign of these correlations vary according to the type of road (motorways, rural roads or urban roads). Moreover, in the case of the interurban network in France, it appears that the rainfall effect is mainly direct on motorways – exposure being unchanged, and partly indirect on main roads – as a result of changes in exposure. Additional results obtained on a daily basis for the Athens region indicate that capturing the within-the-month variability of the weather variables and including it in a monthly model highlights the effects of extreme weather. Such findings are consistent with previous results obtained for France using a similar approach, with the exception of the negative correlation between precipitation and the number of injury accidents found for the Athens region, which is further investigated. The outlook for the approach and its added value are discussed in the conclusion.},

The reduction of visual performance through rain was considered with respect to two driving tasks: the detection of an object on the road (contrast threshold) and reading a road sign. This experiment was conducted in a laboratory under controlled artificial rain. Two levels of rain intensity were compared, as well as two wiper conditions (new and worn), while the reference condition was without rain. The reference driving situation was night driving. Effects of both the rain level and the wipers characteristics were found, which validates the proposed methodology for the quantitative estimation of rain countermeasures in terms of visual performance.},

We study the relationship between ambient temperatures and human sleep using daily district-level data on sleep duration collected by nearly half a million individual consumer wearable sensors in Germany from 2020 to 2022. Our results illustrate a nonlinear relationship between temperature and sleep duration. Average sleep duration decreases at high temperatures and is unaffected by low temperatures. For instance, we find a small but statistically significant reduction in average sleep duration of 2.8\% (12 min and 8 s) on a tropical night (when daily minimum temperature exceeds 20 °C) compared to a mid-temperature night. We document corresponding changes in physical activity (number of daily steps) and vital signs (resting heart rate) at high minimum temperatures, which could represent potential mechanisms for the link between temperature and sleep.},

  abstract = {For all road managers, inclement weather events are a source of uncertainty that can affect traffic operations and safety. Regarding safety, various studies reveal significant effects of adverse weather conditions on the frequency and severity of crashes. Regarding mobility, because of a lack of data, there are few comprehensive studies, although the quantification of the effects of adverse weather on traffic represents the first step toward the development of weather-responsive traffic management strategies. This study deals with the analysis of the impact of rain on drivers’ behavior and traffic operations. First, a generic methodology for assessing the effect of weather on traffic is proposed through a multilevel approach: from individual traffic data, the rain impact is assessed at a microscopic level (time headways, spacing). Next, the same data were used to extend the study to a mesoscopic and a macroscopic level. The mesoscopic level deals with the effects of rain on platoons, and the macroscopic level resides in the analysis of the impact of rain on the fundamental diagram enabling weather-responsive macroscopic traffic simulation. Second, following this approach, an empirical study is carried out from individual data collected on a French interurban motorway. Weather data were provided by a weather station located near the test site. The results exhibit a significant impact of rain on drivers’ behavior and traffic operations, which increases with the intensity of rainfall.},

  abstract = {Rainfall is one of many types of weather hazard that can lead to motor vehicle crashes. To better understand the link between rainfall and crash rates, daily gridded precipitation data and automobile crash data are gathered for six U.S. states (Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio) for the period 1996–2010. A matched pair analysis is used to pair rainfall days with dry days to determine the relative risk of crash, injury, and fatality. Overall, there is a statistically significant increase in crash and injury rates during rainfall days of 10\% and 8\%, respectively, leading to an additional 28 000 crashes and 12 000 injuries in the 1 May–30 September period each year relative to what would be expected if those days were dry. The risk of crashes and injuries increases for increasing daily rainfall totals, with an overall increase in crashes and injuries of 51\% and 38\% during days with more than 50 mm (2 in.) of rainfall. While urban counties and rural counties with and without interstates each saw increased crash risk during rainfall, urban counties saw the most significant increases in relative risk. There are a number of exceptions to these broad spatial patterns, indicating that relative risk varies in ways that are not explained solely by meteorological factors.},

  abstract = {Objective: This study aims to characterize Portuguese car drivers in terms of demographic characteristics, driving experience, and attitudes, opinions, and behaviors concerning road traffic safety. Furthermore, associations between these characteristics and self-reported involvement in a road traffic accident as a driver in the last 3~years were analyzed. A final goal was to develop a final predictive model of the risk of suffering a road traffic accident. Methods: A cross-sectional analytic study was developed, based on a convenience sample of 612 car drivers. A questionnaire was applied by trained interviewers, embracing various topics related to road safety such as driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, phone use while driving, speeding, use of advanced driver assistance systems, and the transport infrastructure and environment (European Project SARTRE 4, Portuguese version). From the 52 initial questions, 19 variables were selected through principal component analysis. Then, and in addition to the usual descriptive measures, logistic binary regression models were used in order to describe associations and to develop a predictive model of being involved in a road traffic accident. Results: Of the 612 car drivers, 37.3\% (228) reported being involved in a road traffic accident with damage or injury in the past 3~years. In this group, the majority were male, older than 65, with no children, not employed, and living in an urban area. In the multivariate model, several factors were identified: being widowed (vs. single; odds ratio [OR] = 3.478, 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 1.159–10.434); living in a suburban area (vs. a rural area; OR = 5.023, 95\% CI, 2.260–11.166); having been checked for alcohol once in the last 3~years (vs. not checked; OR = 3.124, 95\% CI, 2.040–4,783); and seldom drinking an energetic beverage such as coffee when tired (vs. always do; OR = 6.822, 95\% CI, 2.619–17.769) all suffered a higher risk of being involved in a car accident. Conclusions: The results obtained with regard to behavioral factors meet the majority of the risk factors associated with car accidents referred to in the literature. This study highlights the relation of relatively minor accidents (the majority with no injuries) with an urban (or semi-urban) context and involving older drivers. These accidents are not usually the focus of road safety literature (mainly death and serious health loss) but, in addition to the economic costs involved, they can have a huge impact on road safety (e.g., pedestrian). Specifically, the following interventions can be proposed: more detailed clinical examinations to identify real competencies to drive especially in older drivers (active aging can constitute a new challenge in road safety and new paradigms can arise) and education campaigns on how to cope with fatigue. Future studies in large samples and not based on self-reported behaviors should be developed.},

However, most studies use monthly or yearly data and only few studies are available analyzing the impact of weather conditions on daily car crash counts. Furthermore, the studies that are available on a daily level do not explicitly model the data in a time-series context, hereby ignoring the temporal serial correlation that may be present in the data. In this paper, we introduce an integer autoregressive model for modelling count data with time interdependencies. The model is applied to daily car crash data, metereological data and traffic exposure data from the Netherlands aiming at examining the risk impact of weather conditions on the observed counts. The results show that several assumptions related to the effect of weather conditions on crash counts are found to be significant in the data and that if serial temporal correlation is not accounted for in the model, this may produce biased results.},

Several studies have stated that rain, snow, wind speed, and visibility loss cause reductions in speed and capacity. Understanding these relationships is important to managing the traffic flow appropriately. This paper presents new research that evaluates the free-flow speed reduction caused by inclement weather conditions, including rain, snow, wind speed, and visibility loss. Fifteen freeway locations in northwestern Spain were selected for the study. Data were collected in 15-min intervals by weather and traffic stations for almost 3 years, from 2006 to 2008. Individual correlations between the weather and traffic variables were examined to select the most important weather variables and to identify speed trends and thresholds. All climate conditions were divided into four groups: no precipitation and temperatures above 0°C, no precipitation and temperatures below 0°C, rain, and snow conditions. A multiple nonlinear regression analysis was performed with the final variables. Results showed that rain and snow both caused a reduction in speed, with a more dramatic reduction during snow conditions. Wind speed over 8 m/s affected traffic speed, while the effect of visibility loss presented a logarithmic form. It was also determined that the location caused the variables to affect the speed differently, so further research should utilize a greater number of sites.},

Every month from June 2023 to June 2024 set a new record, and September shattered the previous record by \textbackslash 0.5\textbackslash °C. The 2023 annual average approached \textbackslash 1.5\textbackslash °C above pre-industrial levels. This results from both long-term warming and internal variability, with the occurrence of an El Niño episode. However the amplitude of the 2023/24 anomalies was remarkable and surprised the scientific community. Here we analyze the rarity of 2023/24 global temperatures from a climate perspective. We show that a ‘normal’ year 2023 would have roughly equaled the previous annual record, and that the most extreme events of 2023/24 rank among the most extreme since 1940. Our analysis suggests that the 2023/24 event can be reconciled with the long-term trend and an intense, but not implausible, peak of internal variability.},

The study focused on drivers aged between 14 and 64 years. The characteristics considered were the age, gender, type of vehicle and occupation of the individuals involved and the location, time and severity of the accident. Two periods were compared, 1997–2000 and 2003–2006. Three types of journey were considered: while at work, commuting (going to and from work), and non-work-related. The percentage of all accidents which were work-related varied little over the decade (10\% while at work and 18\% while commuting). The accidents that occurred while at work still had the lowest fatality rates (1.4\% among women and 3.4\% among men in 2003–2006). Men accounted for the majority of the casualties: 90\% of fatalities while at work and approximately 80\% for the other types of journey. The greatest reduction took place in the number of motorists, and this has led to an increase in the proportion of motorized two-wheelers both while at work and while commuting. In the case of accidents while at work, the professional drivers still had the highest risk, craftsmen and shopkeepers were also at higher risk than manual workers of both genders and male employees. Extending analysis of this type to other European countries would be of major interest both for epidemiological monitoring and the prevention of occupational road accidents.},

  abstract = {Background: Global warming and increasing extreme weather have become a severe problem in recent years, posing a significant threat to human health worldwide. Research exploring the link between injury as one of the leading causes of death globally and ambient temperature was lacking. Based on the hourly injury emergency ambulance dispatch (IEAD) records from 2019–2021 in the main urban area of Chongqing, this study explored the role of temperature extremes on the pathogenesis of injury by different mechanisms and identified sensitive populations for different mechanisms of injury. Methods: In this study, we collected hourly injury emergency ambulance dispatch (IEAD) records from Chongqing Emergency Dispatch Center in the main urban area of Chongqing from 2019 to 2021, and used a distributed lagged nonlinear model (DLNM) with quasi-Poisson distribution to evaluate the association between ambient temperature and IEADs. And the stratified analysis was performed by gender, age and different injury mechanisms to identify susceptible groups. Finally, the attributable burden of ambient extreme temperatures was also investigated. Results: The risk for total IEADs increased significantly at high temperature (32 °C) compared with optimal temperature (9 °C) (CRR: 1.210; 95\%CI[1.127,1.300]). The risks of traffic accident injury (CRR: 1.346; 95\%CI[1.167,1.552]), beating injury (CRR: 1.508; 95\%CI[1.165,1.952]), fall-height injury (CRR: 1.871; 95\%CI[1.196–2.926]) and injury of sharp penetration (CRR: 2.112; 95\%CI[1.388–3.213]) were significantly increased. At low temperature (7 °C), the risk of fall injury (CRR: 1.220; 95\% CI [1.063,1.400]) increased significantly. Lag for 24 hours at extreme low temperature (5 °C), the risk of 18–45 years (RR: 1.016; 95\%CI[1.009,1.024]) and over 60 years of age (RR: 1.019; 95\%CI[1.011,1.025]) increased significantly. The effect of 0 h delay in extreme high temperature (36 °C) on males aged 18–45 years (RR: 1.115; 95\%CI[1.071,1.162]) and 46–59 years (RR: 1.069; 95\%CI[1.023,1.115]) had significant impact on injury risk. Conclusions: This study showed that ambient temperature was significantly related to the risk of injury, and different mechanisms of injury were affected differently by extreme temperature. The increasing risk of traffic accident injury, beating injury, fall-height injury and sharp penetrating injury was associated with extreme heat, while fall injury was associated with extreme cold. The risk of injury in high temperature environment was mainly concentrated in males and young adults. The results of this study can help to identify the sensitive population with different injury mechanisms in extreme temperature environment, and provide reference for public health emergency departments to respond to relevant strategies in extreme temperature environment to minimize the potential risk to the public. © The Author(s) 2023.},

However, evidence on such associations in tropical urban settings where the climate differs is limited. Methods: National level data on road locations with injury-causing RTAs in Singapore was obtained. We linked the accident data to weather exposure measures from the nearest weather station. We used a time-stratified, case-crossover analytical study design, the Distributed Lag Non-Linear Modelling framework and conditional logistic regression to assess the association between weather exposures and the odds of injury-causing traffic accidents on roads. Results: There were 42,989 injury-causing RTAs from January-2016 to November-2021. Cool temperatures (adjusted OR25°C: 1.087, 95 \% CI: 1.023 to 1.156) and higher rainfall (adjusted OR38mm: 1.168, 95 \% CI: 1.129 to 1.208) were positively associated with increased odds of injury-causing traffic accidents. These effects were greater on expressways compared to normal roads, suggesting potential effect modification by road type. Conclusion: Lower ambient temperature and higher rainfall were positively associated with injury-causing RTAs in Singapore. Prevention measures ought to be timed with anticipated cooler and wetter days to maximise their uptake and effectiveness among motorists, especially those who use expressways frequently. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

The chapter then considers the case in economics that the response is only observed on a certain range of values. In this case, one can say that the dependent variable is truncated. The chapter further describes the estimators used with cross-sectional data for three categories of models: binomial and ordinal models, truncated and censored models, and count data models and presents the estimators appropriate for panel data. It concludes by providing different empirical examples of the models presented.},

  abstract = {A model is said to be dynamic when one of the regressors is the lagged dependent variable. The usefulness of panel data for estimating dynamic models is self-evident: it is impossible to estimate a dynamic relationship on cross-sectional data while, in the case of time series data, such model cannot be precisely estimated without drawing on long enough a sample. This chapter presents the models that are well suited to “micro-panels”. It also summarizes various estimation strategies that can be adopted to attain consistency of dynamic models: the first is using the maximum likelihood method; the second consists in starting with a biased estimator and then correcting the bias; and the third possibility is using the instrumental variables method. Another estimation method is the generalized method of moments (GMM) and this is an efficient method for dynamic panels.},

  abstract = {Driving performance deteriorates at high ambient temperatures. Less is known about the effect of low ambient temperatures and the role of subjective aspects like thermal comfort and having control over the ambient temperature. Therefore, an experiment was constructed in which 50 subjects performed a road-tracking task in a cold (5°C), a thermoneutral (20°C) or a warm (35°C) climate. All subjects had a heater/blower (H/B) which generated a fixed amount of heat/wind that could either be controlled or not controlled. In the cold climate, averaged leg skin temperature dropped to 18.5°C and head skin temperature to 24.9°C; the thermal comfort was rated between ‘cold’ and ‘very cold’. In the warm climate, averaged leg skin temperature rose to 36.6°C and head skin temperature to 30.8°C; the thermal comfort was rated as ‘hot’. Driving performance in the ambient temperature extremes decreased 16\% in the cold environment and 13\% in the warm situation. Having control over the local head temperature by adjusting a H/B affected neither thermal comfort nor driving performance. In agreement with the literature on priming effects, subjects who started with the no-control condition performed much better in all driving tasks because they were primed to focus on the driving task as such, rather than the complex combination of temperature controls and driving task. It can be concluded that a thermoneutral temperature in a car enhances driving performance and may thus positively affect safety. Using manual climatic controls in hot or cold cars may interfere with the driving task.},

The commuter roads experience lowest reductions in traffic volume due to cold (up to 14\%) while the recreational roads experience highest reduction (up to 31\%). Impact of cold on off-peak hours (−10\% to −15\%) is generally higher than peak hours (−6\% to −10\%) for commuter roads and an opposite pattern is observed for recreational roads (peak hour reductions of 30–58\% and off-peak hour reductions of 18–30\%). A clear indication of reduction in traffic volume due to snow is also observed for all types of highways.

Each survey recorded the 2-lane carriageway. Manual observations were made also concerning the weather at the time of each survey. For consistency commuter speeds occurring on the same weekday peak hour were recorded for a six month period (8–9 am Tuesday mornings), thus, effectively controlling many other external factors that might influence vehicle speeds. Hourly traffic flow information was obtained from an automatic traffic counter located at the survey site. Analysis of this not only confirms the peak hour, but also the consistency the commuters' daily travel routine. Speeds in inclement weather are compared with those in fine conditions (the control). This study finds a small, but significant reduction in mean speeds in both wet weather and misty conditions, and yet such speed modifications are not sufficient to compensate for the increased hazard posed by inclement weather.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This paper investigates the relationship between precipitation and traffic crashes in the US during the period 1975–2000. Traffic crashes represent the leading cause of death and injury for young adults in the US, and the ninth leading cause of death for the overall population. Prior studies have found that precipitation raises the risk of traffic crashes significantly. Methods: A negative binomial regression approach is employed. Two different units of analysis are examined: state–months and state–days. The sample includes all 48 contiguous states. Results: A surprising negative and significant relationship between monthly precipitation and monthly fatal crashes is found. However, in the daily level analysis, a strong positive relationship is estimated, as in prior studies. The source of the contrasting results appears to be a substantial negative lagged effect of precipitation across days within a state–month. In other words, if it rained a lot yesterday, then on average, today there are fewer crashes. Additional analysis shows that the risk imposed by precipitation increases dramatically as the time since last precipitation increases. For example, 1cm of precipitation increases the fatal crash rate for a state–day by about 3\% if exactly 2 days have passed since the last precipitation and by about 9\% if more than 20 days have passed. This basic pattern holds for non-fatal crashes as well. Conclusions: The lagged effects of precipitation across days may be explained by the clearing of oil that accumulates on roads during dry periods or by the conditioning of people to drive more safely in wet conditions. Either way, policy interventions that prepare drivers more adequately for the risks of precipitation following dry periods are likely to be beneficial.},

It addresses a research gap by providing an updated assessment using high-resolution reanalysis daily minimum and maximum temperature data (Tmin and Tmax) from the gridded ERA5-Land dataset, overcoming the lack of publicly available daily temperature records. To assess the representation of the previous dataset, nine different grid-point locations across the country were considered. By comparing monthly ERA5-Land temperature data to ground-based records from the Portuguese Met Office, a monthly validation of the data was conducted for the longest common period, demonstrating good agreement between the two datasets. The heatwave magnitude index (HWMI) was employed to establish the temperature thresholds and thus identify heatwaves (defined as three or more consecutive days above the threshold). With over 640 Tmin heatwave days recorded at each of the nine ERA5-Land grid-points, data analysis revealed a discernible upward trend in Tmin heatwaves. The grid-point situated in the capital city’s urban area, i.e., Lisbon, exhibited the highest number of Tmin heatwave days. With an average of more than 800 Tmax heatwave days over the 41-year period, the northern and interior regions of Portugal had the greatest number of occurrences, reaching up to 916. A kernel rate estimation method was applied to further investigate the annual frequency of Tmin and Tmax heatwave occurrences. Results exhibited clear temperature changes, with a widespread increase in the number of heatwave days over the past two decades, particularly for Tmax. In summary, the occurrence of this phenomenon displayed significant spatial variations, with the southern interior and coastal grid-points experiencing a greater increase in annual Tmax heatwave days, rising from 10 to 30 between 2018 and 2019.},

The study has two primary objectives: assessing the hydrological spatial dynamics of a region susceptible to climate-induced variations in exceptional rainfall and evaluating the proficiency of a ERA5-Land reanalysis rainfall dataset in capturing exceptional rainfall. Confronting methodological and data-related challenges (e.g., incomplete record series), the investigation uses continuous daily ERA5-Land rainfall series. Validation against the Sistema Nacional de Informação de Recursos Hídricos (SNIRH) and the Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA) ensures the reliability of ERA5-Land data. Empirical non-exceedance probability curves reveal a broad consensus between reanalysis data and observational records, establishing the dataset’s suitability for subsequent analysis. Spatial representations of occurrences, cumulative rainfall, and rainfall intensity of events above thresholds throughout the overall 42-year period and two subperiods (late: 1981/1982–2001/2002; and recent: 2002/2003–2022/2023) are presented, illustrating spatial and temporal variations. A noteworthy shift in the spatial distribution of intense events from south to north is observed, emphasising the dynamism of such hydrological processes. The study introduces a novel dimension with a severity heat map, combining some key findings from the occurrences and cumulative rainfall through subperiods. This study significantly contributes to the understanding of hydrological dynamics in Portugal, providing valuable insights for risk management and the development of sustainable strategies tailored to the evolving patterns of exceptional rainfall.},

Locations are categorised in the heatmap according to whether they experienced (i) more occurrences and more temperature excess, (ii) more occurrences but less temperature excess, (iii) fewer occurrences but more temperature excess, or (iv) fewer occurrences and less temperature excess. From the historical (1980–2002) to the contemporary (2002–2024) phase, results indicate a significant increase in the severity of extreme heat, particularly in central and southern Portugal, with over 90\% of locations exhibiting a rise in exceptional event occurrences. While the Student’s t-test indicated significant differences in both occurrence and temperature excess between the phases, Sen’s slope estimation showed steady upward trends. The results point to crucial regions in the interior and southern Portugal that have warmed the most, posing growing threats to agriculture, human health, and water resources. Although slight cooling trends were observed in a few northern and central coastal regions, the overall pattern highlights an increase in extreme heat. This research is particularly relevant given the recent changes in exceptional Tmax identified in Portugal, aligning with broader climate change patterns and trends.},

  abstract = {To effectively reduce traffic violations that often cause severe crashes at signalized intersections, exploring their contributing factors seems hugely urgent and essential. This study attempted to investigate the influence factors of wrong-way driving (WWD), red-light-running (RLR), violating traffic markings (VTM), and driving in the inaccurate oriented lane (DIOL) at signalized intersections by using data collected from traffic enforcement camera in Hohhot, China. To this end, an ordinary multinomial logit model was developed. By considering the unobserved heterogeneity between observations, a random effects multinomial logit model was proposed as well. After that, the marginal effects of explanatory variables were computed. The outcomes showed that non-local vehicles were more likely to commit WWD and VTM than local vehicles. WWD and RLR frequently occurred in the daytime and evening (6:00–23:59), and on most days within a week. RLR and DIOL mainly happened in June and July. The left-turn lane ratio significantly increased RLR and DIOL. The cloudy, partly cloudy, and rainy days obviously increased WWD and VTM. The temperature from 21 to 30 degrees centigrade was apparently associated with the higher likelihoods of RLR and DIOL. According to the findings of this study, some intervention measures, targeting different vehicle types and considering temporal factors, road, and weather conditions, were recommended to reduce WWD, RLR, VTM, and DIOL at signalized intersections.},

Objectives To examine whether fatigue and sleep quality in a healthy Japanese population were affected by rising air temperature at three time points in summer and to investigate the confounding factors for fatigue. Methods A total of 602 healthy volunteers in Osaka, Japan, participated in a survey that was conducted at the end of July, August, and September in 2010. The questionnaire consisted of four sections; demographic variables, accommodation status, fatigue, and sleep quality. We used the Chalder fatigue scale for assessment of fatigue, and the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for assessment of sleep quality. Results The fatigue score was positively correlated with the sleep quality score in the total cohort. All the questionnaires at the three time points were completed by 162 participants. There were significant differences in fatigue scores among the surveys. We stratified the subjects into two groups of good and poor sleepers using a cutoff value of the PSQI. The good sleepers did not show differences in fatigue score regardless of the change in air temperature. However, the fatigue score of poor sleepers was greater at higher air temperatures. The use of air conditioners, accommodation type, and subject’s age were confounding factors for fatigue. Conclusions High air temperatures in summer increased fatigue in healthy volunteers, especially those with poor sleep patterns, depending on the use of air conditioners, accommodation status, and subject’s age.},

These tests were performed at the start (T1), after 1 h 30 min (T2), 3 h (T3) and 4 h 30 min (T4) of exposure in both hot (HOT) (Wet Bulb Globe Temperature [WBGT] = 38° ± 1.4°C) and neutral control (CON) (WBGT = 19° ± 0.3°C) environments. Environmental temperatures were adjusted during the HOT session to induce target core temperatures (Tcore) (T1 ~ 37.3°; T2 ~ 37.8°; T3 ~ 38.3°; T4 ~ 38.8°C). At T1 and T4 the OTS-6 was lower in HOT than in CON in response to the rapid increase in skin temperature and to hyperthermia, respectively. In HOT, the increase in Tcore limited force production capacity possibly via alterations occurring upstream the motor cortex (from Tcore ~ 37.8°C) but also via a decrement in motor cortical excitability (from Tcore ~ 38.3°C). These alterations in cortex excitability failed to explain the cognitive alterations that can originate from an additional cognitive load imposed by temperature variations.},

  abstract = {Despite the relevance of road crashes and their impact on social and health care costs, the effects of extreme temperatures on road crashes risk have been scarcely investigated, particularly for those occurring in occupational activities. A nationwide epidemiological study was carried out to estimate the risk of general indistinct and work-related road crashes related with extreme temperatures and to identify crash and occupation parameters mostly involved. Data about road crashes, resulting in death or injury, occurring during years 2013–2015 in Italy, were collected from the National Institute of Statistics, for general indistinct road crashes, and from the compensation claim applications registered by the national workers' compensation authority, for work-related ones. Time series of hourly temperature were derived from the results provided by the meteorological model WRF applied at a national domain with 5 km resolution. To consider the different spatial-temporal characteristics of the two road crashes archives, the association with extreme temperatures was estimated by means of a case-crossover time-stratified approach using conditional logistic regression analysis, and a time-series analysis, using over-dispersed Poisson generalized linear regression model, for general indistinct and work-related datasets respectively. The analyses were controlled for other covariates and confounding variables (including precipitation). Non-linearity and lag effects were considered by using a distributed lag non-linear model. Relative risks were calculated for increment from 75th to 99th percentiles (hot) and from 25 to first percentile (cold) of temperature. Results for general indistinct crashes show a positive association with hot temperature (RR = 1.12, 95 \% CI: 1.09–1.16) and a negative one for cold (RR = 0.93, 95 \% CI: 0.91−0.96), while for work-related crashes a positive association was found for both hot and cold (RR = 1.06 (95 \% CI: 1.01–1.11) and RR = 1.10 (95 \% CI: 1.05–1.16). The use of motorcycles, the location of accident (urban vs out of town), presence of crossroads, as well as occupational factors like the use of a vehicle on duty were all found to produce higher risks of road crashes during extreme temperatures. Mitigation and prevention measures are needed to limit social and health care costs.},

We aimed to quantify the total mortality burden attributable to non-optimum ambient temperature, and the relative contributions from heat and cold and from moderate and extreme temperatures. Methods We collected data for 384 locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and USA. We fitted a standard time-series Poisson model for each location, controlling for trends and day of the week. We estimated temperature–mortality associations with a distributed lag non-linear model with 21 days of lag, and then pooled them in a multivariate metaregression that included country indicators and temperature average and range. We calculated attributable deaths for heat and cold, defined as temperatures above and below the optimum temperature, which corresponded to the point of minimum mortality, and for moderate and extreme temperatures, defined using cutoffs at the 2·5th and 97·5th temperature percentiles. Findings We analysed 74\hphantom{,}225\hphantom{,}200 deaths in various periods between 1985 and 2012. In total, 7·71\% (95\% empirical CI 7·43–7·91) of mortality was attributable to non-optimum temperature in the selected countries within the study period, with substantial differences between countries, ranging from 3·37\% (3·06 to 3·63) in Thailand to 11·00\% (9·29 to 12·47) in China. The temperature percentile of minimum mortality varied from roughly the 60th percentile in tropical areas to about the 80–90th percentile in temperate regions. More temperature-attributable deaths were caused by cold (7·29\%, 7·02–7·49) than by heat (0·42\%, 0·39–0·44). Extreme cold and hot temperatures were responsible for 0·86\% (0·84–0·87) of total mortality. Interpretation Most of the temperature-related mortality burden was attributable to the contribution of cold. The effect of days of extreme temperature was substantially less than that attributable to milder but non-optimum weather. This evidence has important implications for the planning of public-health interventions to minimise the health consequences of adverse temperatures, and for predictions of future effect in climate-change scenarios.

Over 560 government agencies have access to Waze reports, and many are using them as data sources for operations. This study evaluated the accuracy of Waze crash and disabled vehicle reports along a 2.7-mile section of urban freeway by comparing Waze reports with images from four traffic cameras. Because the cameras were pan-tilt-zoom capable and operated by transportation management center staff, a surrogate measure for transportation agency awareness was used, defined as the time at which the camera panned or zoomed to an ongoing incident. Of 40 crashes reported in Waze, 13 (33\%) were confirmed primary reports and 2 (5\%) were false alarms. Of the 560 disabled vehicle reports, 125 (22\%) were confirmed primary reports and 131 (23\%) were false alarms. For disabled vehicles, neither a Waze report's reliability score nor an incident's duration was correlated with report accuracy. For both crashes and disabled vehicles, transportation management center staff was usually aware of the incident before the first Waze report, although this may be biased as the study corridor had dense camera coverage. This is the first study to evaluate the accuracy of individual Waze crash and disabled vehicle reports using ground truth evidence.},

The Poisson FE model is particularly simple and is one of a small few known models in which the incidental parameters problem is, in fact, not a problem. The same is not true of the negative binomial (NB) model. Researchers are sometimes surprised to find that the HHG formulation of the FENB model allows an overall constant a quirk that has also been documented elsewhere. We resolve the source of the ambiguity, and consider the difference between the HHG FENB model and a  true  FENB model that appears in the familiar index function form.The familiar RE Poisson model using a log gamma heterogeneity term produces the NB model. The HHG RE NB model is also unlike what might seem the natural application in which the heterogeneity term appears as an additive common effect in the conditional mean. We consider the lognormal model as an alternative RENB model in which the common effect appears in a natural index function form.},

Understanding how extreme weather events affect traffic crashes is crucial for assessing traffic risk factors and enhancing road safety. In this study, we utilized Hot Spot Analysis coupled with the Theil index and Spatial Durbin Model to investigate the characteristics of traffic crashes that occur on extremely hot days, using an 8-year panel dataset from the State of Florida, USA. The results revealed: 1) Crashes during extreme hot days (EHDs) show significant spatial clustering in regions typically characterized by colder climate zones, as temperature fluctuations from heat waves heighten the likelihood of traffic incidents. 2) Crashes during EHDs are more variable within regions experiencing high temperatures, where heat stress is compounded by high humidity or typical temperatures of tropical areas. 3) Crashes resulting from extreme heat are not isolated incidents but part of a chain reaction, highlighting the need for a systemic understanding of the hazards posed by extreme heat. Based on these insights, the study proposes targeted strategies to mitigate the risks associated with traffic crashes during EHDs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Since a variety of other economic data come in the form of repeated counts of some individual actions or events, the methodology should have wide applications. The statistical models we develop are applications and generalizations of Poisson distribution. Two important issues are (i) Given the panel nature of our data, how can we allow for separate persistent individual (fixed or random) effects? (ii) How does one introduce the equivalent of disturbances-in-the-equation into the analysis of Poisson and other discrete probability functions? The first problem is solved by conditioning on the total sum of outcomes over the observed years, while the second problem is solved by introducing an additional source of randomness, allowing the Poisson parameter to be itself randomly distributed, and compounding the two distributions. Lastly, we develop a test statistic for the presence of serial correlation when fixed effects estimators are used in nonlinear conditional models.]}

  abstract = {Background Previous studies have shown that extreme heat likely increases the risk of road injuries. However, the global burden of road injuries due to high temperature and contributing factors remain unclear. This study aims to characterize the global, regional and national burden of road injuries due to high temperature from 1990 to 2019. Methods Based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019, we obtained the numbers and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALY) rates (ASDR) of the road injury due to high temperature at global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2019. The world is divided into five climate zones according to the average annual temperature of each country: tropical, subtropical, warm temperate, cold temperate, and boreal. We used the generalized additive models (GAM) to model the trends of road injuries globally and by region. Results Globally, between 1990 and 2019, the deaths of road injury attributable to high temperature increased significantly from 20,270 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI], 7836 to 42,716) to 28,396 (95\% UI, 13,311 to 51,178), and the DALYs increased from 1,169,309 (95\% UI, 450,834 to 2,491,075) to 1,414,527 (95\% UI, 658,347 to 2,543,613). But the ASMR and the ASDR slightly decreased by 8.49\% and 13.16\%, respectively. The burden of road injury death attributable to high temperature remained high in low SDI and tropical regions. In addition, road transport infrastructure investment per inhabitant is associated with the burden of road injuries attributable to high temperature. Conclusions Globally, the ASMR and ASDR for road injuries attributable to high temperature decreased from 1990 to 2019, but the absolute death and DALYs continued to increase. Thus, concerning global warming, implementation of prevention and interventions to reduce road injuries from heat exposure should be stressed globally.},

  abstract = {We study the asymptotic properties of the popular fixed effects Poisson (FEP) estimator in two scenarios important for empirical research. First, we allow for multiplicative measurement error and characterize when the FEP estimator consistently estimates the parameters. Second, we allow for unbalanced panels and characterize when the estimator is consistent under the complete cases. We propose simple tests to determine whether selection is systematically related to unobserved time-varying shocks, which can cause the FEP estimator to be inconsistent. A simulation shows that the predictions of the theoretical findings hold in reasonable sample sizes.},

By running Monte Carlo simulations, I compare the finite-sample properties of the cross-sectional dependence–consistent Driscoll–Kraay estimator with the properties of other, more commonly used covariance matrix estimators that do not account for cross-sectional dependence. The results indicate that Driscoll–Kraay standard errors are well calibrated when cross-sectional dependence is present. However, erroneously ignoring cross-sectional correlation in the estimation of panel models can lead to severely biased statistical results. I illustrate the xtscc program by considering an application from empirical finance. Thereby, I also propose a Hausman-type test for fixed effects that is robust to general forms of cross-sectional and temporal dependence.},

For the first time, this study uses precipitation radar along with a state-of-the art traffic information system to ascertain the relationship between speed–flow and precipitation on a UK transport corridor at the local (junction to junction) scale. It is evident that precipitation causes a significant reduction in speed and maximum flow on many links of the corridor as well as a downward reduction in the overall speed-flow relationship. With increased instances of heavy precipitation predicted in the UK as a result of climate change, these findings highlight the subsequent impact on journey travel times and associated economic costs.},

  abstract = {Obtaining accurate speed and travel time information is a challenge for researchers, geographers, and transportation agencies. In the past, traffic data were usually acquired and disseminated by government agencies through fixed-location sensors. High costs, infrastructure demands, and low coverage levels of these sensor devices require agencies and researchers to look beyond the traditional approaches. With the emergence of smartphones and navigation apps, location-based and crowdsourced Big Data are receiving increased attention. In this regard, location-based big data (LocBigData) collected from probe vehicles and road users can be used to provide speed and travel time information in different locations. Examining the quality of crowdsourced data is essential for researchers and agencies before using them. This study assessed the quality of Waze speed data from surface streets and conducted a case study in Sevierville, Tennessee. Typically, examining the quality of these data in surface streets and arterials is more challenging than freeways data. This research used Bluetooth speed data as the ground truth, which is independent of Waze data. In this study, three steps of methodology were used. In the first step, Waze speed data was compared to Bluetooth data in terms of accuracy, mean difference, and distribution similarity. In the second step, a k-means algorithm was used to categorize Waze data quality, and a multinomial logistics regression model was performed to explore the significant factors that impact data quality. Finally, in the third step, machine learning techniques were conducted to predict the data quality in different conditions. The result of the comparison showed a similar pattern and a slight difference between datasets, which verified the quality of Waze speed data. The statistical model indicates that that Waze speed data are more accurate in peak hours than in night hours. Also, the traffic speed, traffic volume, and segment length have a significant association on the accuracy of Waze data on surface streets. Finally, the result of machine learning prediction showed that a KNN method performed the highest prediction accuracy of 84.5\% and 82.9\% of the time for training and test datasets, respectively. Overall, the study results suggest that Waze speed data is a promising data source for surface streets.},

Here we quantify the linkage between ambient temperature exposure and the MVC risk of the driver in four cities of the United States. After adjusting for confounding factors, we find both a cold effect and a hot effect on MVC in New York, and a cold effect on MVC in Chicago. A 1 °C decrease in mean daily temperature below a cold threshold of −4.8 °C is associated with an increase in the overall cumulative relative risk of MVC by 11.59\% (95\% CI: 5.17\%–16.43\%) over 0–28 lag days for New York. The respective risk increase is 1.58\% (95\% CI: 0.36\%–2.79\%) over 0–2 lag days for a 1 °C increase in mean daily temperature above the hot threshold of 26.1 °C for New York. There is no significant heat wave or cold spell effects except for the heat wave effect on the consecutive heat wave days 7–10 in New York. Our study provides evidence of the association between driver exposure to low or high temperatures and the MVC risk. Improved public- administration preventive measures and policymaking are needed to minimize the negative consequences of abnormal temperatures on road safety driving.},

  abstract = {Does the environment have a causal effect on economic development? Using meteorological data, we reconstruct every country's exposure to the universe of tropical cyclones during 1950-2008. We exploit random within-country year-to-year variation in cyclone strikes to identify the causal effect of environmental disasters on long-run growth. We compare each country's growth rate to itself in the years immediately before and after exposure, accounting for the distribution of cyclones in preceding years. The data reject hypotheses that disasters stimulate growth or that short-run losses disappear following migrations or transfers of wealth. Instead, we find robust evidence that national incomes decline, relative to their pre-disaster trend, and do not recover within twenty years. Both rich and poor countries exhibit this response, with losses magnified in countries with less historical cyclone experience. Income losses arise from a small but persistent suppression of annual growth rates spread across the fifteen years following disaster, generating large and significant cumulative effects: a 90th percentile event reduces per capita incomes by 7.4\% two decades later, effectively undoing 3.7 years of average development. The gradual nature of these losses render them inconspicuous to a casual observer, however simulations indicate that they have dramatic influence over the long-run development of countries that are endowed with regular or continuous exposure to disaster. Linking these results to projections of future cyclone activity, we estimate that under conservative discounting assumptions the present discounted cost of "business as usual" climate change is roughly \$9.7 trillion larger than previously thought.},

Here, I review, synthesize, and interpret recent advances in methods used to measure effects of climate on social and economic outcomes. Because weather variation plays a large role in recent progress, I formalize the relationship between climate and weather from an econometric perspective and discuss the use of these two factors as identifying variation, highlighting trade-offs between key assumptions in different research designs and deriving conditions when weather variation exactly identifies the effects of climate. I then describe recent advances, such as the parameterization of climate variables from a social perspective, use of nonlinear models with spatial and temporal displacement, characterization of uncertainty, measurement of adaptation, cross-study comparison, and use of empirical estimates to project the impact of future climate change. I conclude by discussing remaining methodological challenges.},

This study examined the association between ambient temperatures and different injury mechanisms to identify vulnerable populations in Shanghai. Methods: Injury-related emergency ambulance dispatch records and corresponding meteorological data for the period 2016–2021 were obtained from the Shanghai Emergency Dispatch Center and the Shanghai Meteorological Service. A distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) with a quasi-Poisson distribution was applied to evaluate the association between ambient temperatures and injury-related emergency ambulance dispatches. Subgroup analyses were further conducted by gender, age group, and injury mechanisms to identify vulnerable populations. Results: Extreme temperatures were associated with increases in total injury-related emergency ambulance dispatches, as well as traffic accidents, falls, and assault injuries. Low temperatures were linked to an elevated risk of fall injuries, particularly among women aged 46 years and above. In contrast, extreme heat was associated with increased risks of traffic accidents and assault injuries among individuals aged 18–45, with assault injuries showing a particularly pronounced association among men. Conclusions: Our findings can guide prehospital emergency service departments in developing targeted interventions to reduce injury incidence and mortality during extreme temperature events. © 2024},

  abstract = {Climate change leads to more frequent and intense weather events, posing escalating risks to road traffic. Crowdsourced data present new opportunities to monitor and investigate road traffic changes during adverse weather. This study utilizes two types of crowdsourced data: passively collected location data (PCLD) from mobile devices and actively collected user reports (ACUR) from the WAZE app, to examine the impact of floods, winter storms, and fog on road traffic. Three metrics derived from PCLD—speed change, event duration, and area under the curve (AUC)—along with an additional metric from ACUR, user-perceived severity, are utilized to assess link-level traffic resilience. All metrics are correlated with road characteristics such as functional class, number of lanes, divider types, road geometry, and historical traffic, to analyze underlying relationships and make forecasting. Using the Dallas–Fort Worth (DFW) metroplex in 2022 as a case, the study finds that overall, winter storms have the most substantial impact on road traffic, followed by floods and fog. Travel demand metrics, such as POI visits and traffic volume, experience a more significant decrease than traffic speed. The impact of weather also varies by road characteristics, with higher-class roads with greater volume and higher speed experiencing more substantial changes. Road geometry, such as minimal altitude and slopes, also significantly influences road traffic resilience under floods but not during winter storms. Moreover, the study reveals that ACUR may not accurately reflect the actual impact during extreme weather events, as few users are able to travel outside to actively act as “sensors”. In sum, this study evaluates a set of crowdsourced data for assessing link-level traffic resilience, designs various resilience metrics, and examines how they vary across road attributes and weather events, which are essential for guiding disaster preparedness, response, and recovery in road transportation systems.},

Data science plays an important role in its explanation and prediction. One of the main objectives of RTA data analysis is to identify the main factors associated with a RTA. The present study aims to contribute to the identification of the determinants for the type of RTA: collision, crash, or pedestrian running-over. These factors are essential for identifying specific countermeasures because there is a relevant relationship between the type of RTA and its severity. Daily RTA data from 2016 to 2019 in a district of Portugal were analyzed. A statistical multinomial logit model was fitted. The identified determinants for the type of RTA were geographical (municipality, location, and parking areas), meteorological (air temperature and weather), time of the day (hour, day of the week, and month), driver’s characteristics (gender and age), vehicle’s features (type and age) and road characteristics (road layout and type). The multinomial model results were compared with several machine learning algorithms, since the original data of the type of RTA are severely imbalanced. All models showed poor performance. However, when combining these models with ROSE for class balancing, their performance improved considerably, with the random forest algorithm showing the best performance.},

  abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak motivated the development of a myriad of weekly and daily indicators that track economic activity to estimate and predict the consequences of the pandemic. With some exceptions, these indicators are calculated at the country level and are mainly focused on tracking economic factors, disregarding local urban phenomena. To address this, we present the Urban Dynamic Indicator (UDI), a novel composite indicator designed to measure a city's daily urban dynamic. The UDI is applied to Porto municipality, in Portugal, and it corresponds to a latent factor obtained through a factor analysis over seasonal adjusted daily data regarding traffic intensity, public transportation usage, internet usage in public buses, NO2 emissions and noise level. The UDI's values show that, by the end of 2020, despite the approach of economic activity to its pre-pandemic values, as suggested by the Portuguese Daily Economic Indicator (DEI), Porto urban dynamic did not recover completely. The UDI enriches the information available for Porto city planners and policymakers to respond to crisis situations and to gauge the application of local policies that contribute to urban sustainable planning. Furthermore, the methodology defined in this work can be followed for the development of daily urban dynamic indicators elsewhere. © 2022},

  abstract = {Illegal parking represents a costly problem for most cities as it leads to an increase in traffic congestion and emission of air pollutants, and decreases pedestrian, biking, and driving safety, making cities less clean, secure, and attractive to citizens and tourists. Most decision-support systems employed to deal with parking illegalities rely on cameras and video-processing algorithms to capture infractions in real-time. Despite being effective, their implementation is costly and challenging due to road environment conditions. On the other hand, studies that relay on spatiotemporal features to predict infractions can present a more efficient alternative, one that is less costly to implement and free of environment and spatial conditioning. In this work, we propose the Illegal Parking Score (IPS), a score of the conditional probability of illegal parking occurring in a road segment, based on spatiotemporal conditions, and able to distinguish between illegality types. The IPS is calculated for the Lisbon Municipality, in Portugal, and it is supported by a Light Gradient Boosting Machine model that allows for IPS prediction for unseen conditions. Likewise, we propose the IPS Simulator, a simulation tool that allows for users to infer the IPS by defining spatiotemporal conditions. This system will be deployed in the Lisbon City Council and provides responsible authorities with a tool to support their daily operations and promote sustainable transport and demand planning, by identifying and monitoring critical zones and by aiding in the design and gauge of parking regulation. © 2022 World Conference on Transport Research Society},

  abstract = {Cities that prioritize sustainability leverage data from daily urban activities to make informed decisions. Research has shown the effectiveness of indicators regarding traffic, public transport, shared mobility, and air quality data to manage and monitor urban systems. However, there has been limited effort to develop composite indicators that represent multiple phenomena in a single metric. We propose a high-resolution spatiotemporal indicator to measure urban dynamic (UDI). We collected hourly data on traffic, public transport usage, e-scooter trips, and air quality in Porto, Portugal. Factor analysis was applied to extract the composite indicator and provide a holistic view of the city's dynamic. Results revealed higher dynamic in the northwest and southwest areas in the Aldoar, as well as in some areas in Cedofeita and Bonfim parishes. The UDI showed higher values on business days than on weekends, the afternoon period displayed the highest dynamic, while traffic flow was the variable with the highest impact. Using mobile phone location data, we evaluated the UDI's values, demonstrating its ability to support data-driven decision-making and inform interventions by city planners. © 2023},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel and rigorous approach to the analysis of the impact of rainfall on road traffic accidents in urban areas. It is argued that previous approaches to rainfall quantification for accident analysis, primarily using a representative surface meteorological station to represent an urban area, may not give an accurate record of the conditions across the city in question. Using an innovative city-wide weather radar approach to rainfall quantification and matched-pairs analysis, road accidents in the UK cities of Manchester and Greater London are examined over a 3-year baseline period (2008–2011). A comparative study is made over the same period used a traditional station-based approach. The resulting relative accident rates demonstrate divergence between the two cities and the two approaches. Although the stricter criteria for a rain event under the weather radar approach gives an increased RAR in Manchester, the RAR observed under these conditions decreases in Greater London. Reasons for the variation in RAR are explored and include traffic volume and speed, other coincident weather conditions and driver behaviour, in accordance with Elvik’s (2006) laws of accident causation. It is argued that the approach described in this study offers significant improvements to the analysis of current weather-related accidents by giving a more representative measure of rainfall in urban areas.},

  abstract = {We investigate the impact of rainfall on daily road accidents in the metropolitan area of Melbourne, Australia, over 1987–2002. Our analysis from several viewpoints of the accident count, which has been normalised for variation in traffic volume, indicated that the effect of rainfall is multifaceted. Owing to a large non-linear trend a subdivision into three epochs (1987–1991, 1992–1996 and 1997–2002) was made. Nominal daytime and nighttime as well as 3h raw counts were available for the first two epochs only. Generally, the effect of rainfall across the epochs shows a tendency for larger values in autumn with smaller values in spring. For the daily, daytime and nighttime cases there is an approximate 40\% decrease in both the volume-normalised dry and wet means from the first to second epoch. Since the second epoch is wetter than the first, and both dry and wet cases are affected in a similar way, then it appears that a non-weather influence is at work. It is suggested that law enforcement measures may be largely responsible. We obtained a conservative estimate of relative risk of an accident in wet conditions based on a matched-pair analysis of 3h dry and wet periods over the first two epochs (1987–1996). As with other studies we find that the risk is greater than unity in almost all cases suggesting that the presence of rainfall consistently represents a driving hazard. Rainfall occurring after a dry spell has an enhanced effect on the volume-normalised accident count as the spell duration increases. The effect of dry spells is more clearly described when broken down by rain class. Generally, there is an increase in the impact of a dry spell when it first rains as the spell duration and rainfall amount increase.},

Despite mixed evidence on many issues, several patterns can be observed. On a global scale especially shifts in tourism and agricultural production due to increased temperatures may lead to shifts in passenger and freight transport. The predicted rise in sea levels and the associated increase in frequency and intensity of storm surges and flooding incidences may furthermore be some of the most worrying consequences of climate change, especially for coastal areas. Climate change related shifts in weather patterns might also cause infrastructure disruptions. Clear patterns are that precipitation affects road safety by increasing accident frequency but decreasing severity. Precipitation also increases congestion, especially during peak hours. Furthermore, an increased frequency of low water levels may considerably increase costs of inland waterway transport. Despite these insights, the net impact of climate change on generalised costs of the various transport modes are uncertain and ambiguous, with a possible exception for inland waterway transport.},

Thirty-six subjects (18 males and 18 females) were exposed to each of the three conditions for 4.5 h in a design balanced for order of presentation of conditions. During each exposure, they rated the physical environment, their comfort, the intensity of acute subclinical health symptoms, and their mental load, and they performed a number of cognitive tasks. Their physiological reactions were monitored. The subjects rated T24 to be comfortably cool, T26 to be comfortably neutral, and T28 to be comfortably warm. Their self-estimated performance did not differ between conditions but 12 of 14 objective metrics of cognitive performance decreased significantly at the elevated temperatures: compared with T24, their average cognitive performance decreased by 10\% at T26 and by 6\% at T28. At the elevated temperatures, their parasympathetic nervous system activity (as indicated by PNN50) and their arterial blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2) were both lower, which would be expected to result in reduced cognitive performance. The subjects also rated their acute subclinical health symptoms as more intense and their workload as higher at the elevated temperatures. These results suggest that where cognitive performance is the priority, it is wise to ensure a comfortably cool environment. The present study also supports the use of fans or natural ventilation to reduce the need for mechanical cooling.},

Twelve subjects (six men and six women) performed neurobehavioral tests and tasks typical of office work while thermally neutral (at 22°C) and while warm (at 30°C). Multiple physiological measurements and subjective assessment were made. The results show that when the subjects felt warm, they assessed the air quality to be worse, reported increased intensity of many sick building syndrome symptoms, expressed more negative mood, and were less willing to exert effort. Task performance decreased when the subjects felt warm. Their heart rate, respiratory ventilation, and end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide increased significantly, and their arterial oxygen saturation decreased. Tear film quality was found to be significantly reduced at the higher temperature when they felt warm. No effects were observed on salivary biomarkers (alpha-amylase and cortisol). The present results imply that the negative effects on health and performance that occur when people feel thermally warm at raised temperatures are caused by physiological mechanisms. Practical Implications This study indicates to what extent elevated temperatures and thermal discomfort because of warmth result in negative effects on health and performance and shows that these could be caused by physiological responses to warmth, not by the distraction of subjective discomfort. This implies that they will occur independently of discomfort, i.e. even if subjects have become adaptively habituated to subjective discomfort. The findings make it possible to estimate the negative economic consequences of reducing energy use in buildings in cases where this results in elevated indoor temperatures. They show clearly that thermal discomfort because of raised temperatures should be avoided in workplaces.},

A quantitative relationship was established between thermal sensation votes and task performance. It can be used for economic calculations pertaining to building design and operation when occupant productivity is considered. The relationship indicates that optimum performance can be achieved slightly below neutral, while thermal discomfort (feeling too warm or too cold) leads to reduced performance.

  abstract = {Objective Although traffic accidents are associated with weather, the influence of temperature on injuries from traffic accidents has not been evaluated sufficiently. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of temperature, especially cold temperatures, on injuries from traffic accidents in Seoul, Korea. We also explored the relationship of temperature with different types of traffic accident. Methods The daily frequencies of injuries from traffic accidents in Seoul were summarized from the integrated database established by the Korea Road Traffic Authority. Weather data included temperature, barometric pressure, rainfall, snow, and fog from May 2007 to December 2011. The qualitative relationship between daily mean temperature and injuries from traffic accidents was evaluated using a generalized additive model with Poisson distribution. Further analysis was performed using piecewise linear regression if graph the showed non-linearity with threshold. Results The incidence of injuries was 216 per 100,000 person–months in Seoul. The effect of temperature on injuries from traffic accidents was minimal during spring and summer. However, injuries showed a more striking relationship with temperature in winter than in other seasons. In winter, the number of injuries increased as the temperature decreased to {$<$}0°C. The injuries increased by 2.1\% per 1°C decrease under the threshold of the daily average temperature −5.7°C, which is 10-fold greater than the effect of temperature above the threshold. Some groups were more susceptible to injuries, such as young and male drivers, according to the types of traffic accident when the temperature decreased to below the freezing temperature. Conclusions The incidence of injuries increased sharply when the temperature decreased below freezing temperature in winter. Temperature can be effectively used to inform high risk of road traffic injuries, thus helping to prevent road traffic injuries.},

In particular, rain-related factors are an important cause of traffic accidents due to the poor visibility and reduced friction resulting from slippery road conditions. This paper presents a systematic approach to analyze the extent to which the rainfall intensity and level of water depth are responsible for traffic accidents using Seoul City, Korea, as a case study. The rainfall and traffic accident data over a nine-year period (from 2007 to 2015) for Seoul were analyzed through Structural Equation Modeling to identify the relationships among variables by handling endogenous and exogenous variables simultaneously. In the model, four latent variables, namely those representing the road; traffic, environmental, and human factors; and rain and water depth factors, were defined and the coefficients of the latent, endogenous, and exogenous variables were estimated to obtain the level of accident severity. Furthermore, a statistical goodness of fit index was suggested for model fitting. In conclusion, traffic, environmental, and human factors; rain and water depth factors; and road factors are mutually correlated with the level of accident severity. Compact cars, young drivers, female drivers, heavy rain, deep water, and roads with a long drainage length are more likely to be associated with an increase in the level of accident severity, as are features like a tangent, down slope, right-hand curve, and shorter curve length.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This paper investigates the thermal conditions inside a passenger car driven after it was left a few hours in a shade-less parking lot, and the related implications for the driving performance. Materials and methods: Experimental results for twelve tests carried out in four different vehicles are presented and discussed. Each test is characterized by means of the predicted core temperature tcore of the driver after 60 minutes, as calculated by a heat stress model. The fractional performance loss is calculated by adjusting existing algorithms for office tasks to accommodate literature data on driving-related tasks, and then re-casting the algorithm as a function of tcore instead of the air temperature ta. Results: Based on measured temperatures and humidities, fractional performance losses up to 50\% are predicted even for relatively simple tasks such as keeping the vehicle on a straight course. Performance losses in excess of 75\% are predicted, under the most extreme thermal conditions, for demanding tasks, such as correctly identifying a signal and reacting in due time. Conclusions: The implementation in technical standards on heat stress assessment of two new thresholds is recommended. The lower threshold, to be set at tcore ≅ 37.1 °C, is aimed at ensuring that the subject is able to carry out demanding mental tasks without appreciable performance loss, while the higher threshold, to be set at tcore ≅ 37.2 °C applies to simpler tasks.},

  abstract = {Traffic accidents cause considerable economic losses and injuries. Although the adverse effects of a change in ambient temperatures on human health have been widely documented, its effects on road traffic safety are still debated. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to synthesize available data on the association between ambient temperature and the risks of road traffic accidents (RTAs) and traffic accident injuries (TAIs). We searched 7 different databases to locate studies. The subgroup analyses were stratified by temperature type, temperature exposure, region, mean temperature, mortality, study period, statistical model, and source of injury data. This study was registered with PROSPERO under the number CRD42021264660. This is the first meta-analysis to investigate the association between ambient temperature and road traffic safety. A total of 34 high-temperature effect estimates were reported, and two additional studies reported the relationship between low temperatures and TAI risk. The meta-analysis results found a significant association between the high temperature and RTAs, and the pooled RR was 1.025 (95\%CI 1.014, 1.035). The risk of TAI was also significantly associated with temperature increases. Subgroup analyses found that using daily mean temperatures, the RR value of road traffic accidents was 1.024 (95\%CI 0.939, 1.116), and the RR value of road traffic injuries was 1.052 (95\%CI 1.024, 1.080). Hourly temperatures significantly increased the risk of RTA, while the risk of TAI was not significantly increased by hourly temperature. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were stable, and no obvious publication bias was detected. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that increases in ambient temperature are associated with an increased risk of RTAs and TAIs. These findings add to the evidence of the impact of ambient temperature on road traffic safety.},

In this study, a comprehensive analysis of how climate change may affect Portugal (located in a climate change hotspot) is conducted, providing the foundations to the first National Roadmap for Adaptation 2100. A multi-variable ensemble was built and tested, being the baseline for assessing future projections for three different emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) throughout the 21st century, accounting for the model's ability to simulate a set of variables. A warmer and drier future climate is projected for the mainland, being more severe in the interior regions. Even for the optimistic RCP2.6 scenario, results indicate increases in temperature between 1 and 2 degrees C in comparison with the historical period and can surpass 6 degrees C in some regions for RCP8.5. Extreme hot events will be more frequent and severe, with maximum temperatures above 45 degrees C being more common throughout the 21st century. A decline in precipitation is ex-pected mostly in summer and intermediate seasons, with losses above 40 \% for the end-of-century. However, an intensification of heavy short-term rainfall events is projected to increase in northern regions. A rising of maximum wind gusts is also expected in these regions. Such projections call for an urgent planning and adap-tation measures to safeguard critical sectors of the Portuguese society. Finally, the information here produced and examined constitutes a key example of climate services for mitigation and adaptation in Portugal.},

  abstract = {Identification of traffic crash hot spots is of great importance for improving roadway safety and maintaining the transportation system’s sustainability. Traditionally, police crash reports (PCR) have been used as the primary source of crash data in safety studies. However, using PCR as the sole source of information has several drawbacks. For example, some crashes, which do not cause extensive property damage, are mostly underreported. Underreporting of crashes can significantly influence the effectiveness of data-driven safety analysis and prevent safety analysts from reaching statistically meaningful results. Crowdsourced traffic incident data such as Waze have great potential to complement traditional safety analysis by providing user-captured crash and traffic incident data. However, using these data sources also has some challenges. One of the major problems is data redundancy because many people may report the same event. In this paper, the authors explore the potential of using crowdsourced Waze incident reports (WIRs) to identify high-risk road segments. The researchers first propose a new methodology to eliminate redundant WIRs. Then, the researchers use WIRs and PCRs from an I-35 corridor in North Texas to conduct the safety analysis. Results demonstrated that WIRs and PCRs are spatially correlated; however, their temporal distributions are significantly different. WIRs have broader coverage, with 60.24 percent of road segments in the study site receiving more WIRs than PCRs. Moreover, by combining WIRs with PCRs, more high-risk road segments can be identified (14 miles) than the results generated from PCRs (8 miles).},

In this study, we investigated the coverage, timeliness, and location accuracy of Waze user reports over the years (2018–2021) by comparing their reports with official abnormal event records. The results indicate that the coverage of Waze reports is not constant over time and space. The matching rate of Waze crashes to official records was affected by traffic volumes. It dropped at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020) and recovered gradually in 2021, coinciding with the decline and recovery of traffic during the COVID-19 period. Other factors affecting the matching rate include incident duration and location. In addition, Waze reports were timely. On average, 55\% of the crashes were reported sooner by Waze users than by the official records. Location accuracy was evaluated as well, and the average absolute distance difference was 0.40 mi for crashes and 0.29 mi for stopped vehicles. Nearly all (90\%) of the distance differences between Waze reports and Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) records were between −0.85 and 0.80 mi for crashes and −0.67 to 0.62 mi for stopped vehicles. No obvious change in the spatiotemporal accuracy over time could be observed. Moreover, those Waze reports that could not be matched to TDOT records were analyzed, and the number of crashes covered by those reports was estimated. The results suggest that Waze reports have potential value in identifying missed/unreported crash records and complementing the existing incident database.},

  abstract = {Background Previous studies have shown increased precipitation to be associated with higher frequency of traffic collisions. However, data regarding how extreme weather events, projected to grow in frequency, intensity, and duration in response to a changing climate, might affect the risk of motor vehicle collisions is particularly limited. We investigated the association between frequency of extreme heat and precipitation events and risk of motor vehicle collision in Maryland between 2000 and 2012. Methods Motor vehicle collision data was obtained from the Maryland Automated Accident Reporting System. Each observation in the data set corresponded to a unique collision event. This data was linked to extreme heat and precipitation events that were calculated using location and calendar day specific thresholds. A time-stratified case-crossover analysis was utilized to assess the association between exposure to extreme heat and precipitation events and risk of motor vehicle collision. Additional stratified analyses examined risk by road condition, season, and collisions involving only one vehicle. Results Overall, there were over 1.28 million motor vehicle collisions recorded in Maryland between 2000 and 2012, of which 461,009 involved injuries or death. There was a 23\% increase in risk of collision for every 1-day increase in extreme precipitation event (Odds Ratios (OR) 1.23, 95\% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.22, 1.27). This risk was considerably higher for collisions on roads with a defect or obstruction (OR: 1.46, 95\% CI: 1.40, 1.52) and those involving a single vehicle (OR: 1.41, 95\% CI: 1.39, 1.43). Change in risk associated with extreme heat events was marginal at best. Conclusion Extreme precipitation events are associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle collisions in Maryland.},

However, in the absence of detailed driving data that would help improve the identification of cause and effect relationships with individual vehicle crashes, most researchers have addressed this problem by framing it in terms of understanding the factors that affect the frequency of crashes – the number of crashes occurring in some geographical space (usually a roadway segment or intersection) over some specified time period. This paper provides a detailed review of the key issues associated with crash-frequency data as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the various methodological approaches that researchers have used to address these problems. While the steady march of methodological innovation (including recent applications of random parameter and finite mixture models) has substantially improved our understanding of the factors that affect crash-frequencies, it is the prospect of combining evolving methodologies with far more detailed vehicle crash data that holds the greatest promise for the future.},

  abstract = {Using volunteered geographic information (VGI) to supplement disaster risk management systems, including forecasting, risk assessment, and disaster recovery, is increasingly popular. This attention is driven by difficulties in detection and characterization of hazards, as well as the rise of VGI appropriate for characterizing specific forms of risk. Flash-flood historical records, especially those that are impact-based, are not comprehensive, leading to additional barriers for flash-flood research and applications. In this paper we develop a method for associating VGI flood reporting clusters against authoritative data. Using Hurricane Harvey as a case study, VGI reports are assimilated into a spatial analytic framework that derives spatial and temporal clustering parameters supported by associations between Waze’s community-driven emergency operations center and authoritative reports. These parameters are then applied to find previously unreported likely flash flood-events. This study improves the understanding of the distribution of flash flooding during Hurricane Harvey and shows potential application to events in other areas where Waze data and reporting from official sources, such as the National Weather Service, are available.},

  abstract = {The possible associations between climate parameters and drivers’ fatigue have not been subject to specific studies thus far. We have undertaken a study to investigate whether the particular climate parameters are related to fatigue perception by motor vehicle drivers. The study was performed from July to October. Each driver was surveyed four times: before and after workshift on a monotonous route outside the city center (MR), and on a heavy traffic route in the city center (HTR). The study was conducted among 45 city bus drivers aged 31–58~years (43.7\,±\,7.9), seniority as driver 3–34~years (14.7\,±\,8.6). Data on climate conditions (ambient temperature, air pressure, humidity, wind speed, precipitations) on particular study days was obtained from the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management, National Research Institute Warsaw, Poland. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Assessment Questionnaire, developed at Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine (Lodz, Poland). The total level of fatigue was significantly (p\,=\,0.045) higher after driving on HTR than on MR. The number of symptoms was also significantly higher (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) among drivers working on HTR. After MR, significant correlations were found between wind speed and heavy eyelid feeling, being prone to forgetting, eye strain, frequent blinking, and between ambient temperature and feeling thirsty. After HTR feeling thirsty, tiredness and difficulty in making decisions correlated with ambient temperature and feeling thirsty with wind speed. Climate conditions can modify the drivers fatigue; therefore, we should be aware of their impact on well-being.},

  abstract = {This study was designed to investigate the relative accident risk of different road weather conditions and combinations of conditions. The study applied a recently developed method which is based on the notion of Palm probability, originating in the theory of random point processes, which in this case corresponds to picking a random vehicle from the traffic. The method consists of calculating the Palm distribution of different conditions and comparing it with the distribution of the same conditions as seen by the accidents. The condition affects the accident risk statistically, when these two distributions differ. The study included all police reported single- and multi-vehicle accidents (N\,=\,10,646) occurring on 43 main roads in Finland during the years 2014–2016. A major contribution of this paper is the demonstration of the method on national scale by using estimated hourly traffic volumes on road segments instead of measured ones, which would have been available for few roads only. Accident risks are commonly examined in relation to traffic volume. This paper includes the speed of the traffic and thus, the paper examines accident risk in relation to the time spent on the road segment in certain conditions. The hour-level weather and road condition data per segment were obtained from nearby road weather stations. The relative accident risks were increased for poor road weather conditions; however, they were highest for icy rain and slippery and very slippery road conditions. When comparing the relative accident risk based on road type, the results showed that the risk in poor weather and road conditions was higher on motorways compared to two-lane and multiple-lane roads even though the overall risk was lower on motorways. Furthermore, the corresponding relative accident risks were generally higher for single-vehicle accidents compared to multi-vehicle accidents.},

  abstract = {Weather conditions have considerable influence on cycling travel behavior, especially in tropical countries such as Singapore, which has a hot, humid, and rainy climate. This study examined the effects of weather conditions and weather forecasts on cycling travel behavior in Singapore. Cyclists (n = 553) answered a questionnaire on their perceptions of weather conditions, travel accident risk, pre-trip and during-trip acquisition of weather information, possible travel plan changes, trip duration, trip purpose, trip frequency, and respondents' social demography. The questionnaires were administrated directly on sites around mass rapid transit (MRT) stations and bike parking areas during daylight hours (08:00–18:00 h) and in dry as well as wet weather conditions. Concurrently, real-time weather information from the nearest weather measurement station and weather forecast information were collected from a smart phone application furnished by the National Environment Agency. Cyclists were found to prefer relatively lower temperature (29.5–31.5°C) and humidity (52.3\%–62.7\%) and no rainfall (in past 60 min). Higher temperature ({$>$}30.9°C), humidity ({$>$}55.8\%), and rainfall ({$>$}0.28~mm in past 60 min) tended to elevate cyclists' self-estimated level of traffic accident risk. Nearly 30\% of participating cyclists checked the weather forecast information before the onset of the trip, in which internet, radio, and smart phone applications were the main media sources. Social/leisure trip was the main purpose for cyclists during wet weather. Irregular trips were clearly underrepresented during wet weather conditions, suggesting that some trips were postponed or cancelled. Cyclists with before-trip information of wet weather forecast were more likely to change their travel mode, but such influence was weaker for adverse weather forecast acquired during the trip. Research results suggested that the authorities could provide real-time and predicted weather information, especially during wet weather conditions, to help travelers adjust their travel plan in time and improve the level of travel safety.},

However, the impacts of heat waves on economic output are not well captured by standard empirical approaches that ignore when hot days occur. Using a global dataset spanning 1979–2016, we show agricultural losses from past heat waves are up to an order of magnitude larger than suggested by standard approaches. Combining these estimates with a suite of climate models implies that by the end of the century, climate damages in agriculture may be 5–10~times larger than is predicted by a focus on mean temperature shifts alone. These findings have important implications for targeting and evaluating climate adaptation efforts.}

  abstract = {Climate records have been broken with alarming regularity in recent years, but the events of 2023–2024 were exceptional even when accounting for recent climatic trends. Here we quantify these events across multiple variables and show how excess energy accumulation in the Earth system drove the exceptional conditions. Key factors were the positive decadal trend in Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI), persistent La Niña conditions beginning in 2020, and the switch to El Niño in 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, the heating from EEI was over 75\% larger than during the onset of similar recent El Niño events. We show further how regional processes shaped distinct patterns of record-breaking sea surface temperatures in individual ocean basins. If the recent trend in EEI is maintained, we argue that natural fluctuations such as ENSO cycles will increasingly lead to amplified, record-breaking impacts, with 2023–2024 serving as a glimpse of future climate extremes.},

  abstract = {Statistical modeling of traffic crashes has been of interest to researchers for decades. Over the most recent decade many crash models have accounted for extra-variation in crash counts—variation over and above that accounted for by the Poisson density. The extra-variation – or dispersion – is theorized to capture unaccounted for variation in crashes across sites. The majority of studies have assumed fixed dispersion parameters in over-dispersed crash models—tantamount to assuming that unaccounted for variation is proportional to the expected crash count. Miaou and Lord [Miaou, S.P., Lord, D., 2003. Modeling traffic crash-flow relationships for intersections: dispersion parameter, functional form, and Bayes versus empirical Bayes methods. Transport. Res. Rec. 1840, 31–40] challenged the fixed dispersion parameter assumption, and examined various dispersion parameter relationships when modeling urban signalized intersection accidents in Toronto. They suggested that further work is needed to determine the appropriateness of the findings for rural as well as other intersection types, to corroborate their findings, and to explore alternative dispersion functions. This study builds upon the work of Miaou and Lord, with exploration of additional dispersion functions, the use of an independent data set, and presents an opportunity to corroborate their findings. Data from Georgia are used in this study. A Bayesian modeling approach with non-informative priors is adopted, using sampling-based estimation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the Gibbs sampler. A total of eight model specifications were developed; four of them employed traffic flows as explanatory factors in mean structure while the remainder of them included geometric factors in addition to major and minor road traffic flows. The models were compared and contrasted using the significance of coefficients, standard deviance, chi-square goodness-of-fit, and deviance information criteria (DIC) statistics. The findings indicate that the modeling of the dispersion parameter, which essentially explains the extra-variance structure, depends greatly on how the mean structure is modeled. In the presence of a well-defined mean function, the extra-variance structure generally becomes insignificant, i.e. the variance structure is a simple function of the mean. It appears that extra-variation is a function of covariates when the mean structure (expected crash count) is poorly specified and suffers from omitted variables. In contrast, when sufficient explanatory variables are used to model the mean (expected crash count), extra-Poisson variation is not significantly related to these variables. If these results are generalizable, they suggest that model specification may be improved by testing extra-variation functions for significance. They also suggest that known influences of expected crash counts are likely to be different than factors that might help to explain unaccounted for variation in crashes across sites.},

  abstract = {Understanding the underlying relationship between pedestrian injury severity outcomes and factors leading to more severe injuries is very important in addressing the problem of pedestrian safety. This research combines data mining and statistical regression methods to identify the main factors associated with the levels of pedestrian injury severity outcomes. This work relies on the analysis of two unique pedestrian injury severity datasets from New York City, US (2002–2006) and the City of Montreal, Canada (2003–2006). General injury severity models were estimated for each dataset and for sub-populations obtained through clustering analysis. This paper shows how the segmentation of the accident datasets helps to better understand the complex relationship between the injury severity outcomes and the contribution of geometric, built environment and socio-demographic factors. While using the same methodology for the two datasets, different techniques were tested. Within the New York dataset, a latent class with ordered probit method provides the best results. However, for Montreal, K-means with a multinomial logit model proves most appropriate. Among other results, it was found that pedestrian age, location type, driver age, vehicle type, driver alcohol involvement, lighting conditions, and several built environment characteristics influence the likelihood of fatal crashes. Finally, the research provides recommendations for policy makers, traffic engineers, and law enforcement in order to reduce the severity of pedestrian–vehicle collisions.},

  abstract = {Background: There remains a dearth of cross-city comparisons on the impact of climate change through extreme temperature and precipitation events on road safety. We examined trends in traffic fatalities, injuries and property damage associated with high temperatures and heavy rains in Boston (USA) and Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic). Methods: Official publicly available data on daily traffic outcomes and weather conditions during the warm season (May to September) were used for Boston (2002–2015) and Santo Domingo (2013–2017). Daily maximum temperatures and mean precipitations for each city were considered for classifying hot days, warm days, and warm nights, and wet, very wet, and extremely wet days. Time-series analyses were used to assess the relationship between temperature and precipitation and daily traffic outcomes, using a quasi-Poisson regression. Results: In Santo Domingo, the presence of a warm night increased traffic fatalities with a rate ratio (RR) of 1.31 (95\% CI [confidence interval]: 1.00,1.71). In Boston, precipitation factors (particularly, extremely wet days) were associated with increments in traffic injuries (RR 1.25, 95\% CI: 1.18, 1.32) and property damages (RR 1.42, 95\% CI: 1.33, 1.51). Conclusion: During the warm season, mixed associations between weather conditions and traffic outcomes were found across Santo Domingo and Boston. In Boston, increases in heavy precipitation events were associated with higher traffic injuries and property damage. As climate change-related heavy precipitation events are projected to increase in the USA, the associations found in this study should be of interest for road safety planning in a rapidly changing environment. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Total RTA accidents were significantly more common, being directly correlated, with increased dry and wet bulb temperatures and significantly less common, being inversely correlated, with increased relative humidity and amount of precipitation of rain, snow, hail etc. However, RTAs recorded on rainy days only were significantly more common and directly correlated with precipitation (Note days of snow and hail are very rare in Riyadh city). Seasonal variation in RTAs was evident being maximal during the summer season particularly between 12 noon and 3 pm. This period is characterized by heavy traffic and intense sunlight. The role of hot weather prevalent in Saudi Arabia, where average temperatures of 34.4–34.7°C with maximum of 40–42.7°C are common in summer, have been suggested to be an important factor leading to increased stress and decreased performance of intellectual tasks which require considerable physical effort and motor skills. Increased heart rates, exacerbation of existing pathologic conditions such as heart disease and emphysema and loss of visual acuity have been reported. Consequently, prolonged exposure to heat must be considered as a hazard to the safety and health of drivers and a factor leading to an increased incidence of RTAs.},

  abstract = {Interaction between adverse weather conditions and motor vehicle crashes is an important topic for traffic engineers and hydrometeorologists. With the recent availability of high resolution precipitation products (hourly, 4\,×\,4\,km), it is possible to evaluate crash risk during rainfall events more accurately. Texas, the second largest state in the U.S., with a relatively high population density in its eastern part that receives significant rainfall from tropical events, experiences many hazardous traffic conditions every year. This study investigates temporal and spatial variability of the Relative Accident Risk (RAR) due to rainy conditions across Texas during the year 2015 using a Crash-Based Matched Pairs Analysis (CB-MPA) approach for every 4\,×\,4\,km grid using an hourly time scale. The overall findings show that rainfall increases crash risk across the state by about 57\%, while seasonal-based analysis confirms the role of precipitation patterns on crash rates. Although eastern and central counties (wetter and more urbanized) have remarkably higher rates of crash occurrence, the western counties (mainly rural and dry) show higher RAR values. Moreover, higher rainfall intensity can increase RAR up to three-fold while directly having an adverse effect on crash injury type. There is a relatively high correlation between rainfall intensity and RAR values (R2\,=\,0.76). The analysis also shows higher RAR values on high-speed interstate highways and tollways compared to urban local streets. RAR values also vary according to the gender and age of drivers. The study findings shed light on future paths toward more detailed applications of high-resolution environmental data in crash risk analysis.},

On the other hand, days with extremely cold temperature (below −30°C) may have an opposite impact and reduce mortality. Overall, our findings suggest that the economic costs of all-cause mortality due to one day with hot and cold temperatures correspond to 10.25 million USD and 7.91 million USD or 0.28\% and 0.22\% of daily GDP in Russia, respectively. The results also suggest that regions frequently experiencing hot and cold temperatures have adapted to these temperatures.},

  abstract = {Objective: Quantify the effect of thermal stressors on human performance. Background: Most reviews of the effect of environmental stressors on human performance are qualitative. A quantitative review provides a stronger aid in advancing theory and practice. Method: Meta-analytic methods were applied to the available literature on thermal stressors and performance. A total of 291 references were collected. Forty-nine publications met the selection criteria, providing 528 effect sizes for analysis. Results: Analyses confirmed a substantial negative effect on performance associated with thermal stressors. The overall effect size for heat was comparable to that for cold. Cognitive performance was least affected by thermal stressors, whereas both psychomotor and perceptual task performance were degraded to a greater degree. Other variables were identified that moderated thermal effects. Conclusion: Results confirmed the importance of task type, exposure duration, and stressor intensity as key variables impacting how thermal conditions affect performance. Results were consistent with the theory that stress forces the individual to allocate attentional resources to appraise and cope with the threat, which reduces the capacity to process task-relevant information. This represents a maladaptive extension of the narrowing strategy, which acts to maintain stable levels of response when stress is first encountered. Application: These quantitative estimates can be used to design thermal tolerance limits for different task types. Although results indicate the necessity for further research on a variety of potentially influential factors such as acclimatization, the current summary provides effect size estimates that should be useful in respect to protecting individuals exposed to adverse thermal conditions.},

A generalized additive model and meta-analysis were employed to analyze this relationship. We found that the threshold temperatures was observed to be approximately 30 °C. Above this temperature, traffic accidents increased in four urban areas, except Busan, which is a popular tourist location. In total, traffic accidents increased by approximately 0.59\% (95\% confidence interval of 0.41–0.75) per 1 °C increase in the daily maximum temperature, with substantial differences between the different areas, ranging from 0.12\% (CI = −0.26–0.50) in Busan to 1.08\% (CI = 0.45–1.71) in Gwangju. The morning and evening hours showed a greater increase in traffic accidents than other timeframes. The increase in traffic accidents for young casualties was statistically significant at all times, and that for elderly casualties was observed at 10:00–14:00 and 18:00–22:00.

SARAH-3 (SurfAce Radiation DAtaset Heliosat, https://doi.org/10.5676/EUM\_SAF\_CM/SARAH/V003, Pfeifroth et al., 2023) is a new version of a satellite-based climate data record of surface solar radiation parameters, generated and distributed by the European Organisation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF). SARAH-3 provides data from 1983 onwards, i.e. more than 4 decades of data, and has a spatial resolution of 0.05° × 0.05°, a temporal resolution of 30 min and daily and monthly means for the region covered by the Meteosat field of view (65° W to 65° E and 65° S to 65° N). SARAH-3 consists of seven parameters: surface irradiance, direct irradiance, direct normal irradiance, sunshine duration, daylight, photosynthetically active radiation and effective cloud albedo. SARAH-3 data between 1983 and 2020 have been generated with stable input data (i.e. satellite and auxiliary data) to ensure a high temporal stability; these data are temporally extended by operational near-real-time processing – the so-called Interim Climate Data Record. The data record is suitable for various applications, from climate monitoring to renewable energy. The validation of SARAH-3 shows good accuracy (deviations of ~ 5 W m−2 from surface reference measurements for monthly surface irradiance), stability of the data record and further improvements over its predecessor SARAH-2.1. One reason for this improved quality is the new treatment of snow-covered surfaces in the algorithm, reducing the misclassification of snow as clouds. The SARAH-3 data record reveals an increase in the surface irradiance (~ +3 W m−2 per decade) during recent decades in Europe, in line with surface observations.},

  abstract = {This study offers a likely assessment of extreme meteorological events’ impact on human perceptivity, frame of mind or even health during driving which might have had a consequence as a car accident. Research covered an analysis of car accidents during period 2010–2019 in the Wielkopolska (Poland) and four indices like maximum daily temperature, maximum value of humidex, difference between maximum temperatures observed from day to day and also difference between mean atmospheric pressure at the sea level observed from day to day. A distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) approach was used to obtain the relationship between these indices and car accidents. Our finding evidence that the “good weather for a ride” conditions are actually generating an increased risk of accidents. For indices related to high temperature, i.e., maximum temperature and humidex, it was possible to identify the critical values by which the risks of car accidents were the highest. © 2023, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Climate change and sea-level rise are increasingly leading to higher and prolonged high tides, which, in combination with the growing intensity of rainfall and storm surges, and insufficient drainage infrastructure, result in frequent recurrent flooding in coastal cities. There is a pressing need to understand the occurrence of roadway flooding incidents in order to enact appropriate mitigation measures. Agency data for roadway flooding events are scarce and resource-intensive to collect. Crowdsourced data can provide a low-cost alternative for mapping roadway flood incidents in real time; however, the reliability is questionable. This research demonstrates a framework for asserting trustworthiness on crowdsourced flood incident data in a case study of Norfolk, Virginia. Publicly available (but spatially limited) flood incident data from the city in combination with different environmental and topographical factors are used to create a logistic regression model to predict the probability of roadway flooding at any location on the roadway network. The prediction accuracy of the model was found to be 90.5\%. When applying this model to crowdsourced Waze flood incident data, 71.7\% of the reports were predicted to be trustworthy. This study demonstrates the potential for using Waze incident report data for roadway flooding detection, providing a framework for cities to identify trustworthy reports in real time to enable rapid situation assessment and mitigation to reduce incident impact.},

  abstract = {Adverse weather obviously has an impact on vehicle crash rates on roads and highways. However, it would be valuable to quantify the extent to which weather conditions affect the crash rate. To do that, a meta-analysis has been conducted to generalize research findings on this subject and attempt to quantify the impact of weather on traffic crashes. Studies between 1967 and 2005 that examined the interaction of weather and traffic safety were reviewed. Thirty-four papers and 78 records that meet the predetermined criteria were included in the analysis. Crash rates from each study were normalized with respect to effect size for meta-analysis generalization. Results indicate that the crash rate usually increases during precipitation. Snow has a greater effect than rain does on crash occurrence: snow can increase the crash rate by 84\% and the injury rate by 75\%. Further results also suggest that variations in study results can be explained by study design, date of the study, and region or countries included in the study.},

Following the previous finding that such accidents in Finland happen more often (absolutely and relatively) during the summer months, especially during the afternoon, the main aim of this study was to reveal the factors behind such seasonality. The data included the computerized database of the Finnish fatal road accident investigation system restricted to nonprofessional, nonintoxicated car drivers (N=1464) and sample of the original folders (N=101). The results of the analysis on the sample of the original folders showed that investigation teams adequately documented and explained their decisions concerning falling-asleep accidents and that the observed seasonality is a real phenomenon, not a result of bias of the teams. With the exception of 26–35-year-olds, men of all of the other age groups had a notable absolute and relative increase of sleep-related accidents in the summer. Young male drivers (≤25 yrs), followed by the oldest group (≥66 yrs) had the highest increase in the absolute number of sleep-related accidents between the summer and winter months, while the relative change was the highest for ages 56–65. Women showed similar trends. A detailed analysis of 44 cases of summer afternoon falling-asleep accidents revealed that many drivers were engaged in unusual activities the day or night before the accident. The findings are discussed in relation to different driving and lifestyle habits between seasons, including sleep quality.},

Approximately 160 individual studies of perceptual motor performance reported in the literature were summarized based on thermal level, duration of exposure and the type of task performed. Results indicated no dominant effect of duration of exposure to the heat and no dominant effect of thermal level on mental/cognitive tasks. For perceptual motor tasks other than very simple or mental tasks, an onset of performance decrement was noted in the 30-33°C WBGT range of temperature. This temperature level is consistent with the Recommended Exposure Limits for work in the heat at low levels of metabolic heat.},

  abstract = {Summer 2024 was exceptionally warm in northern Fennoscandia, with June-August mean temperatures at several long-term weather stations surpassing the long-standing record set in 1937. In this region, summer mean temperatures have been reconstructed from tree-ring proxies, which provide annually resolved and millennium-long records of past climate. Here we show, using in-situ observations and two different tree-ring reconstructions, that summer 2024 was the warmest summer in 2000 years in northern Fennoscandia. Employing an attribution method based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models, we further estimate that climate change increased the likelihood of this extreme season by a factor of 93 (5–95\% uncertainty range 19–881) and increased the temperature an additional 2.1\,°C (1.4–2.8\,°C). Atmospheric circulation patterns influencing both summers 1937 and 2024 were largely similar, suggesting a comparable large-scale circulation influence. Our findings highlight the impact of climate change for the contemporary heat extremes in Fennoscandia, indicating that the warming of summer climate is emerging from its range of natural climate variability over the last two millennia.},

  abstract = {Disabled or abandoned vehicles (DAVs) cause a significant proportion of non-recurring traffic congestion. Waze data has the potential to help traffic management center (TMC) operators detect and respond to DAVs more quickly, reducing congestion. Previous studies have examined Waze data on a small scale, but not at a statewide level. This paper analyzes over 2\,years of DAV Waze data on Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) limited-access roadways (with more than 10\,million alerts) and compares them with reported DAV events (crashes and non-crash TMC reports). Over 46\% of the DAV events had an associated Waze alert before the DAV event occurred, indicating significant potential for earlier detection. These Waze alerts typically happened about 16\,min before the DAV event and were most common during daytime hours and in urban areas. Two roadway segments, I-4 in FDOT District 5 and State Road 91 (SR-91) in FDOT District 4, were examined in more detail. A methodology was developed to estimate the delay reduction and congestion savings achieved by the earlier detection provided by the Waze alerts for lane-blocking and shoulder-blocking disabled vehicle events. The estimated congestion savings for the second half of 2019 were \$4.3\,million (I-4) and \$2.5\,million (SR-91), with benefit-cost ratios of 61 and 27, respectively. An additional \$4.3\,million could potentially have been saved as a result of Waze alerts allowing responders to reach DAVs before a crash occurred. These results can help agencies understand how crowdsourced data can be effectively utilized to best improve freeway operations.},

Respondents were confronted with hypothetical route choices that differ in respect of travel costs, travel time and crash risk. The survey was completed by 8,002 respondents, equally spread over the four participating countries and representative for each country with regards to gender, age and region. Possible biases caused by problematic choice behaviour such as inconsistent, irrational or lexicographic answers were addressed. The resulting values were estimated by means of a mixed logit model allowing to account for the panel nature of the data. The Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) was estimated at 6.2 Mill EUR, the Value of a Statistical Serious Injury (VSSI) at 950,000 EUR, and the Value of Time (VoT) at 16.1 EUR/h. Consequently, the relative value of avoiding a fatal injury is estimated to be around 7 times higher than the value of an avoided serious injury. The study revealed differences between countries with France showing values that are significantly lower than the average and Germany showing values that are significantly higher. The estimated VSL values are considerably higher than the values currently used in the four countries, but they are within the range of values found in similar stated choice studies. The results can be used as an input in a broad range of socioeconomic studies including cost-benefit analysis and assessments of socioeconomic costs of road crashes.},

Two sets of results are presented. Two-vehicle accidents were modelled by regression; because the time trends in this data appeared to be reasonably consistent, the resulting model was regarded as adequate. In the case of single-vehicle accidents, trends were not consistent over the period, and it was considered that the Box-Jenkins time series method might be more appropriate than simple regression. The principles involved in fitting Box-Jenkins models to this data are explained and the results compared with the regression method. The tentative conclusion drawn from this comparison is that because accident series are generally very “noisy” and autocorrelation among the residuals from standard regressions not very strong, Box-Jenkins models are unlikely to represent the series appreciably better than regression based on the assumption of uncorrelated residuals. Predictions of the alternative models for the years 1979–1981 are presented and discussed.},

Estimation results from regression analysis show that snowfall severity significantly impacts crashes and incidents but the impact diminishes marginally with each additional centimeter of snow. Gap has a significant fixed effect on crashes but its impact on incidents varies significantly across observations. The effect of the mixed precipitation condition is smaller in comparison to an all-snow condition. These results will help inform policy for snow removal and traffic enforcement in areas of high snowfall.},

Based on accident data collected in the field, a negative binomial model of overall accident frequencies is estimated along with models of the frequency of specific accident types. Interactions between weather and geometric variables are proposed as part of the model specifications. The results of the analysis uncover important determinants of accident frequency. By studying the relationship between weather and geometric elements, this paper offers insight into potential measures to counter the adverse effects of weather on highway sections with challenging geometrics.},

  abstract = {Hydration status and the effects of hypohydration have been the topic of much public and scientific debate in recent years. While many physiological responses to hypohydration have been studied extensively, the subjective responses to hypohydration have largely been ignored. The present investigation was designed to investigate the physiological responses and subjective feelings resulting from 13, 24 and 37 h of fluid restriction (FR) and to compare these with a euhydration (EU) trial of the same duration in fifteen healthy volunteers. The volunteers were nine men and six women of mean age 30 (SD 12) years and body mass 71·5 (SD 13·4) kg. Urine and blood samples were collected and subjective feelings recorded on a 100 mm verbally anchored questionnaire at intervals throughout the investigation. In the EU trial the subjects maintained their normal diet. Body mass decreased by 2·7 (SD 0·6) \% at 37 h in the FR trial and did not change significantly in the EU trial. Food intake in the FR trial (n 10) provided an estimated water intake of 487 (SD 335) ml and urinary losses (n 15) amounted to 1·37 (SD 0·39) litres. This is in comparison with an estimated water intake of 3168 (SD 1167) ml and a urinary loss of 2·76 (SD 1·11) litres in the EU trial. Plasma osmolality and angiotensin II concentrations increased from 0–37 h with FR. Plasma volume decreased linearly throughout the FR trial amounting to a 6·2 (SD 5·1) \% reduction by 37 h. Thirst increased from 0–13 h of FR then did not increase further (P{$>$}0·05). The subjects reported feelings of headache during the FR trial and also that their ability to concentrate and their alertness were reduced.},

  abstract = {Objectives: This research aims to identify and analyze the factors affecting accident severity through a macroscopic analysis, with a focus on the comparison between inside and outside urban areas. Disaggregate road accident data for Greece for the year 2008 were used. Methods: Two models were developed, one for inside and one for outside urban areas. Because the dependent variable had 2 categories, killed/severely injured (KSI) and slightly injured (SI), the binary logistic regression analysis was selected. Furthermore, this research aims to estimate the probability of fatality/severe injury versus slight injury as well as to calculate the odds ratios (relative probabilities) for various road accident configurations. The Hosmer and Lemeshow statistic and other diagnostic tests were conducted in order to assess the goodness-of-fit of the model. Results: From the application of the models, it appears that inside urban areas 3 types of collisions (sideswipe, rear-end, with fixed object/parked car), as well as involvement of motorcycles, bicycles, buses, 2 age groups (18–30 and older than 60~years old), time of accident, and location of the accident, seem to affect accident severity. Outside urban areas, 4 types of collisions (head-on, rear-end, side, sideswipe), weather conditions, time of accident, one age group (older than 60~years old), and involvement of motorcycles and buses were found to be significant. Conclusions: Factors affecting road accident severity only inside urban areas include young driver age, bicycles, intersections, and collision with fixed objects, whereas factors affecting severity only outside urban areas are weather conditions and head-on and side collisions, demonstrating the particular road users and traffic situations that should be focused on for road safety interventions for the 2 different types of networks (inside and outside urban areas). The methodology and the results of this research may provide a promising tool to prioritize programs and measures to improve road safety in Greece and worldwide.},

Despite the existence of generally mixed evidence on the effect of traffic parameters, a few patterns can be observed. For instance, traffic flow seems to have a non-linear relationship with accident rates, even though some studies suggest linear relationship with accidents. On the other hand, increased speed limits have found to have a straightforward positive relationship with accident occurrence. Regarding weather effects, the effect of precipitation is quite consistent and leads generally to increased accident frequency but does not seem to have a consistent effect on severity. The impact of other weather parameters on safety, such as visibility, wind speed and temperature is not found straightforward so far. The increasing use of real-time data not only makes easier to identify the safety impact of traffic and weather characteristics, but most importantly makes possible the identification of their combined effect. The more systematic use of these real-time data may address several of the research gaps identified in this research.},

  abstract = {We use a multiple-regime panel smooth transition regression to examine the economic and climatic sources of the nonuniform relationship between El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and maize yields around the globe. While the yield effect is predominantly observed in strongly teleconnected countries, it is amplified in lower income countries, which we attribute to possible lack of resilience to ENSO—induced weather shocks. Both El Niño-like and La Niña-like conditions result in maize yield reduction, but it is during El Niño events when maize yields drop by up to 20\% in most affected countries. Because in many of these countries maize is an important agricultural crop, the presented results are of interest to researchers and policy makers in the areas of world nutrition and international aid. Moreover, because larger share of maize is produced by high income weakly teleconnected countries, the observed geographic heterogeneity of the El Niño impact offers possible benefits from global risk sharing. These findings also offer insights to climate change economics, as possible increased frequency of the ENSO cycle may negatively impact maize production in strongly teleconnected low income countries.},

Across all study countries, we find that 37.0\% (range 20.5–76.3\%) of warm-season heat-related deaths can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change and that increased mortality is evident on every continent. Burdens varied geographically but were of the order of dozens to hundreds of deaths per year in many locations.

  abstract = {Stepping away from traditional crash-based road safety measurements, several safety performance indicators (SPI) have been proposed in the past few years. SPI can incorporate quantitative and qualitative information on specific aspects that are known to have influence in the safety levels and, not only measure the influence of various safety interventions but also enable comparisons between different road systems. This paper presents the results of the application of a road network SPI to the entire Portuguese road network. This SPI aims at evaluating at the network level, if the connections between urban centres within a region are made by the adequate type of roads regarding generic safety criteria. To this end, the connections to be assessed were classified into pre-defined theoretical safety classes, based on the population of the connected urban centres. Then, the observed safety class of these connections was assessed according to the characteristics of their cross-section and associated road environment of the existing connection between the two urban centres. If the observed class is ensured by a road of higher or equal class than the pre-defined theoretical level in all its extension, the link is considered to be of the appropriate class. For each connection, the results of its evaluation are expressed as a binary value: 0 when the class is not appropriate; and 1 when it is appropriate. The evaluation results are weighted by the road length and aggregated by connection class and throughout the whole road network. The results show a satisfactory network configuration with an SPI of 94\% connections with class equal to or higher than the adequate for the type of connection between urban centres they established. The above insights can help in the identification of potential operational inconsistencies that may require safety-related interventions and used for international benchmarks against existing SPI evaluations.},

  abstract = {Two of the major stressors endured by a motorsport athlete (MSA) during a racing event are the effects of heat and carbon monoxide. To date, there has been little research into their combined effect on driving performance. Using an interactive racecar simulator located within an environmental chamber, subjects drove a simulated race (60 min) in environmental conditions similar to those that develop during a NASCAR Winston Cup oval track race (50°C ambient temperature and 10–12\% carboxyhaemoglobin levels). Subjects also completed cool (20°C) and heat only (50°C) race simulations. During the simulations, oxygen consumption, heart rate, core and skin temperatures and psychomotor performance were measured. The results demonstrated that exposure to a racecar micro-environment combining both heat and CO produced significantly greater (P{$<$}0.05) sweat loss and core temperature change (1.53 kg; 1.06°C) when compared to the heat only (1.14 kg; 0.73°C) and cool conditions (0.35 kg; 0.09°C). Furthermore, a significant decrease (P{$<$}0.05) in psychomotor performance was also shown between the heat/CO condition (contact points=38), and both the heat only (25 points) and cool conditions (22 points). It follows that lengthy exposure to these two stressors could produce a substantial decrement in driving performance, thereby endangering the MSA and other race competitors.},

Methods Eleven healthy males (age 22±4y) were instructed to consume a volume of fluid in line with published guidelines (HYD trial) or 25\% of this intake (FR trial) in a crossover manner. Participants came to the laboratory the following morning after an overnight fast. One hour following a standard breakfast, a 120min driving simulation task began. Driver errors, including instances of lane drifting or late breaking, EEG and heart rate were recorded throughout the driving task Results Pre-trial body mass (P=0.692), urine osmolality (P=0.838) and serum osmolality (P=0.574) were the same on both trials. FR resulted in a 1.1±0.7\% reduction in body mass, compared to −0.1±0.6\% in the HYD trial (P=0.002). Urine and serum osmolality were both increased following FR (P{$<$}0.05). There was a progressive increase in the total number of driver errors observed during both the HYD and FR trials, but significantly more incidents were recorded throughout the FR trial (HYD 47±44, FR 101±84; ES=0.81; P=0.006) Conclusions The results of the present study suggest that mild hypohydration, produced a significant increase in minor driving errors during a prolonged, monotonous drive, compared to that observed while performing the same task in a hydrated condition. The magnitude of decrement reported, was similar to that observed following the ingestion of an alcoholic beverage resulting in a blood alcohol content of approximately 0.08\% (the current UK legal driving limit), or while sleep deprived.},

The values have been made comparable by converting them to Euro in 2015-values, adjusted by purchasing power parities. The monetary valuation of preventing a fatality varies from 0.7 to 3.0 million Euro. The valuation of preventing a serious injury ranges from 2.5\% to 34.0\% of the value per fatality and the valuation of preventing a slight injury from 0.03\% to 4.2\% of the value of a fatality. Total costs of road crashes are equivalent to 0.4–4.1\% of GDP. The method used for obtaining valuations has a major impact on values. Most countries rely on the willingness-to-pay (WTP) approach, which gives higher valuations than other methods. Additional explanations for variations in valuations are differences in the cost components included, different definitions of serious and slight injuries and different levels of underreporting. Harmonization of valuation practices is needed for making sound international comparisons of road crash costs and for cost-benefit analysis at supranational level.},

This study updates and extends a previous systematic review, suggesting that future research ought to incorporate social–environmental factors.           Methods:~           We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published and grey literature on MVCs involving Indigenous Peoples in Canada between 2010 and 2020. We focussed on personal (e.g. driving an old vehicle) and community social–environmental–economic factors (e.g. prevalent low socioeconomic status).           Results:~           Eleven comparative cohorts that resulted in 23 at minimum, age-standardised, mortality or morbidity rate outcomes were included in our meta-analysis. Indigenous Peoples were twice as likely as non-Indigenous Peoples to be seriously injured (rate ratio [RRpooled] = 2.18) and more than 3 times as likely to die (RRpooled = 3.40) in MVCs. Such great risks to Indigenous Peoples do not seem to have diminished over the past generation. Furthermore, such risks were greater on-reserves and in smaller, rural and remote, places.           Conclusion:~           Such places may lack community resources, including fewer transportation and healthcare infrastructural investments, resulting in poorer road conditions in Indigenous communities and longer delays to trauma care. This seems to add further evidence of geo-structural violence (geographical and institutional violence) perpetrated against Indigenous Peoples in yet more structures (i.e. institutions) of Canadian society. Canada's system of highways and roadways and its remote health-care system represent legitimate policy targets in aiming to solve this public health problem.},

Additional orthogonality conditions can be used in a method of moments framework. A second class of problems specifies the conditional mean, conditional variances, and conditional covariances. Using the notion of a conditional linear predictor, it is shown that specification of conditional second moments implies further orthogonality conditions in the observable data that can be exploited for efficiency gains.

  abstract = {Background A better understanding of how heat waves affect fatal traffic crashes will be useful to promote awareness of drivers’ vulnerability during an extreme heat event. Objective and Methods We applied a time-stratified case-crossover design to examine associations between heat waves and fatal traffic crashes during May-September of 2001–2011 in the continental United States (US). Heat waves, defined as the daily mean temperature {$>$}95\% threshold for ≥2 consecutive days, were derived using gridded 12.5 km2 air temperatures from Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). Dates and locations of fatal traffic crash records were acquired from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Results Results show a significant positive association between fatal traffic crashes and heat waves with a 3.4\% (95\% CI: 0.9, 5.9\%) increase in fatal traffic crashes on heat wave days versus non-heat wave days. The association was more positive for 56–65 years old drivers [8.2\% (0.3, 16.7\%)] and driving on rural roadways [6.1\% (2.8, 9.6\%)]. Moreover, a positive association was only present when the heat wave days were characterized by no precipitation [10.9\% (7.3\%, 14.6\%)] and medium or high solar radiation [24.6\% (19.9\%, 29.5\%) and 19.9\% (15.6\%, 24.4\%), respectively]. Conclusions These findings are relevant for developing targeted interventions for these driver groups and driving situations to efficiently reduce the negative effects of heat waves on fatal traffic crashes.},

  abstract = {A total of 83 drivers, 51 males and 32 females, aged 25-65, were recruited to drive an apparently unmodified passenger car for 1 h over at least four laps of a predetermined route on public roads, which included seven sets of traffic lights and sections limited to 50, 70, 90 and 110km/h. They were randomly assigned to one of two thermal conditions (21 or27°C), and drove only during die hours of daylight. A computer initiated unprepared signals to which drivers would normally be alert. Drivers responded by pressing a foot-switch and reporting verbally. Signals were selected at random from 21 possible signals, and were presented for up to 3min, with a random delay of 30-180 s after each response or failure to respond. The negative effect of heat stress on vigilance was statistically significant. At 27°C, the overall proportion of missed signals was 50\% higher and response times were 22\% longer than they were at 21°C. These effects of heat were significant and proportionally greater in the second half-hour, for subjects {$<$}40 years and for speeds below 60km/h (i.e. in city traffic). The latter finding suggests that heat may have increased arousal, and there was some indication of a redistribution of attention away from the most peripheral signals at the higher temperature. Overt driving errors were observed significantly more often at 27°C than at 21°C for women only.},

Reaction ability was evaluated by testing speed estimation, choice reaction, and action judgment. Data for the analysis were retrieved from the Harbin public transport survey of July to October 2014. A total of 680 bus drivers participated in the investigation, and 654 questionnaires and 605 test data were collected. Bus drivers with different characteristics showed different moods and reactions at high temperatures. Young drivers, novice drivers, and drivers who drove for long periods of time without breaks had more negative moods. Continuous driving time had no significant effect on vigor, and all drivers showed low energy. Fatigue increased with continuous driving hours. Older and highly experienced drivers had higher speed estimation accuracy. Speed estimation accuracy and reaction time decreased with sustained driving hours. Before 45\,years of age, the number of choice errors increased with age, but no significant changes were found after 45\,years of age. Drivers between the ages of 55 and 60 showed the worst response times and the maximum number of errors. Negative moods were negatively correlated with speed estimation accuracy and were positively correlated with the number of choices or judgment errors. The vigor was positively associated with speed estimation accuracy and negatively correlated with the number of judgment errors. The findings of the current study provide a comprehensive picture of bus drivers’ reaction ability at high temperatures and could help to take targeted measures to reduce the negative impact of heat exposure.},

  abstract = {Weather is well recognized as a significant environmental factor contributing to higher risk of road crashes. In the conventional road safety studies, weather effects had been set out either based on the instant weather conditions recorded by the police officer attained or the average of meteorological observations over a relatively long time period, such as daily, weekly or even monthly, etc. To the best of our knowledge, it is rare that the lag effect of weather in the preceding period on the crash risk in the current period was attempted. With the use of high-resolution meteorological data in very short time interval, it is possible to evaluate the role of lagged weather effect on safety. In this study, we propose a novel distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM), integrated with case-crossover design, to evaluate the lag effect of weather on crash incidence. The proposed modelling framework could describe the non-linear relationship between weather and crash and the lag effects. Also, the possible over-dispersion and autocorrelation of the time-series weather and crash data can be controlled for. The model was estimated using an integrated meteorological, traffic and crash dataset in Hong Kong. For instances, high resolution data on temperature, humidity, rain intensity and wind speed in 1-hour interval was available. The bi-dimensional exposure-lag-response surfaces are established to visualize the varying effects of possible weather factors on crash risk, with respect to the lag size. Such relationship between effect size and lag size is often overlooked in the literatures. Results indicate that model with 4 degrees of freedom for both weather condition (knots at equal spaces) and lag time (knots at equal intervals) best fit with the observations, in accordance to Quasi-likelihood Akaike information criterion (Q-AIC). Then, stratified analyses are conducted to evaluate the difference in the association among different clusters. Findings should shed light on the modelling of non-linear exposure-response relationship and lag effects in traffic safety time series analysis.},

  abstract = {The existing literature has confirmed that extreme weather such as wind, rain, and snow have a negative impact on cross-sectional traffic flow. However, travel activities with different destination regions, travel distances and vehicle types may have different responses to severe weather. We employ the multilevel mixed-effects negative binomial (MENB) model to explore the interaction effect of severe weather and non-weather factors on intercity origin-destination (OD) demand, based on the data from freeway toll stations in Shandong Province from March 2011 to February 2012. The MENB model is superior to the SNB model in that the former has both smaller AIC (456,645.4 {$<$} 4,586,877.2) and BIC (456,963.4 {$<$} 458,975.8) values and log-likelihood ratio tests. The results indicate that weather impact on freeway travel to the same metropolitan area is homogeneous, and the impact in different metropolitan areas is heterogeneous. Besides, there is an interaction effect between severe weather (strong wind, fog, heavy rain, snow) and travel distance on freeway OD volume. With increasing travel distance, the impact of both strong wind and heavy rain decreases gradually, while the impact of both fog and snow increases. In addition, heat (0.0351 {$>$} 0.0201), strong wind (0.0930 {$>$} 0.0454), and heavy rain (0.1245 {$>$} 0.1044) have a greater impact on passenger car volume than on truck volume, while fog (0.4340 {$<$} 0.4802) and snow (0.4383 {$<$} 0.4884) have a less significant impact on passenger car volume. The findings of this study provide some deep insights into the relationship between severe weather factors and intercity travel demand, which suggests that different strategies of travel demand management should be adopted for different travel distances and different vehicle types under various weather conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Extreme temperature could affect traffic crashes by influencing road safety, vehicle performance, and drivers’ behavior and abilities. Studies evaluating the impacts of extreme temperatures on the risk of traffic crashes have mainly overlooked the potential role of vehicle air conditioners. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the effect of exposure to extreme cold and hot temperatures on seeking medical attention due to motorcycle crashes. The study was conducted in Iran by using medical attendance for motorcycle crashes from March 2011 to June 2017. Data on daily minimum, mean and maximum temperature (°C), relative humidity (\%), wind velocity (km/h), and precipitation (mm/day) were collected. We developed semi-parametric generalized additive models following a quasi-Poisson distribution with the distributed nonlinear lag model to estimate the immediate and lagged associations (reported as relative risk [RR], and 95\% confidence interval [CI]). Between March 2011 and June 2017, 36,079 medical attendances due to motorcycle road traffic crashes were recorded (15.8 ± 5.92 victims per day). In this time period, the recorded temperature ranged from −11.2 to 45.4 °C (average: 25.5 ± 11.0 °C). We found an increased risk of medical attendance for motorcycle crashes (based on maximum daily temperature) at both extremely cold (1st percentile) and hot (99th percentile) temperatures and also hot (75th percentile) temperatures, mainly during lags 0 to 3 days (e.g., RR: 1.12 [95\% CI: 1.05: 1.20]; RR: 1.08 [95\% CI: 1.01: 1.16]; RR: 1.20 [95\% CI: 1.09: 1.32] at lag0 for extremely cold, hot, and extremely hot conditions, respectively). The risk estimates for extremely hot temperatures were larger than hot and extremely cold temperatures. We estimated that 11.01\% (95\% CI: 7.77:14.06) of the medical attendance for motorcycle crashes is estimated to be attributable to non-optimal temperature (using mean temperature as exposure variable). Our findings have important public health messaging, given the considerable burden associated with road traffic injury, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.},

  abstract = {Clustered covariances or clustered standard errors are very widely used to account for correlated or clustered data, especially in economics, political sciences, and other social sciences. They are employed to adjust the inference following estimation of a standard least-squares regression or generalized linear model estimated by maximum likelihood. Although many publications just refer to "the" clustered standard errors, there is a surprisingly wide variety of clustered covariances, particularly due to different flavors of bias corrections. Furthermore, while the linear regression model is certainly the most important application case, the same strategies can be employed in more general models (e.g., for zero-inflated, censored, or limited responses). In R, functions for covariances in clustered or panel models have been somewhat scattered or available only for certain modeling functions, notably the (generalized) linear regression model. In contrast, an object-oriented approach to "robust" covariance matrix estimation  -  applicable beyond lm() and glm()  -  is available in the sandwich package but has been limited to the case of cross-section or time series data. Starting with sandwich 2.4.0, this shortcoming has been corrected: Based on methods for two generic functions (estfun() and bread()), clustered and panel covariances are provided in vcovCL(), vcovPL(), and vcovPC(). Moreover, clustered bootstrap covariances are provided in vcovBS(), using model update() on bootstrap samples. These are directly applicable to models from packages including MASS, pscl, countreg, and betareg, among many others. Some empirical illustrations are provided as well as an assessment of the methods' performance in a simulation study.},

  abstract = {Pedestrians are vulnerable to severe injury and mortality in road crashes. Numerous studies have attempted to identify factors contributing to crashes and pedestrian injury risks. As an active transport mode, the act of walking is sensitive to changes in weather conditions. However, comprehensive real-time weather data are often unavailable for road safety analysis. In this study, we used a geographical information system approach to integrate high-resolution weather data, as well as their corresponding temporal and spatial distributions, with crash data. Then, we established a mixed logit model to determine the association between pedestrian crash severity and possible risk factors. The results indicate that high temperature and the presence of rain were associated with a higher likelihood of Killed and Severe Injury (KSI) crashes. Also, we found the interaction effects of weather condition (hot weather and presence of rain) on the association between pedestrian crash severity and pedestrian and driver behaviors to be significant. For instance, the effects of jaywalking and risky driving behavior on crash severity were more prevalent under rainy conditions. In addition, the effects of driver inattention and reckless crossing were more significant in hot weather conditions. This has critical policy implications for the development and implementation of proactive traffic management systems. For instance, real-time weather and traffic data should be incorporated into dynamic message signs and in-vehicle warning systems. Doing so will enhance the levels of safety awareness of drivers and pedestrians, especially in adverse weather conditions. As a result, pedestrian safety can be improved over the long term.},

  abstract = {Background Although road traffic casualty (RTC) is preventable, it remains the eighth leading cause of death globally, especially in developing countries. Previous studies suggested the association between RTC and monthly or daily weather conditions, while the acute effects of weather conditions on an hourly timescale remains unknown. This study aims to quantify hourly effects of precipitation and temperature on RTC. Methods Using ambulance records on RTC during 2010–2016 for the whole population in Shenzhen, China, we conducted a time-stratified case-crossover design which can inherently control for hour of the day, day of the week, seasonality, time trends and potential time-invariant confounders. Conditional quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag nonlinear model was used to determine the effects of hourly precipitation and temperature on RTC. Results Light and heavy precipitation increased RTC in current and following 2~h by 8.09\% (95\% CI: 4.20–12.12\%) and 11.62\% (95\% CI: 5.93–17.62\%), respectively. A J-shaped temperature-RTC curve revealed that each 1~°C increment above 17~°C were associated with a 0.87\% (0.52–1.22\%) increase in RTC. High temperature accounted for 6.44\% (95\% CI: 3.95–8.91\%) of all RTC, with a high fraction of 10.64\% (95\% CI: 4.33–15.96\%) during warm season and 8.30\% (95\% CI: 4.26–12.66\%) in traffic peak hours. Precipitation contributed to 0.68\% (95\% CI: 0.44–0.92\%) of RTC within 3~h. The middle-aged and female suffered more from precipitation-associated RTC, and the younger suffered more from high temperature-associated RTC. Conclusions High temperature increased substantially hourly RTC. Precipitation was also a risk factor of RTC and the adverse effect lasted for 3~h. The findings would be helpful to guide the development of targeted intervention to accelerate progress in road traffic safety.},

  abstract = {Bicycles held an important position in transportation of China and other developing countries. As accidents rate involving electronic and regular bicycles is increasing, the severity of the bicycle safety problem should be paid more attention to. The current research explored the effect of sunshields (a kind of affordable traffic facility built on stop line of non-motor vehicle lanes (According to National Standard in China, e-bikes share the non-motor vehicle lane with regular bikes.) which was undertaken to avoid riders suffering from sunlight and high temperature) on diminishing red light running behavior of cyclists and e-bike riders. An observational study of 2477 riders was conducted to record and analyze their crossing behaviors at two sites across the city of Hangzhou, China. Results from logistic regression and analysis of variance indicated a significant effect of sunshield on reducing red light infringement rate both on sunny and cloudy days, while this effect of sunshield was larger on sunny days than on cloudy days based on further analysis. The effect of intersection type in logistic regression showed that riders were 1.376 times more likely to run through a red light upon approaching the intersection without sunshields compared to with sunshields in general. The results of MANCOVA further confirmed that rates of running behaviors against red lights were significantly lower at the intersections with a sunshield than at intersections without sunshields when other factors including traffic flow were statistically controlled. To sum up, it is concluded that sunshields installed at intersections can reduce the likelihood of red light infringement of cyclists and e-bike riders on both sunny and cloudy days. For those areas or countries with a torrid climate, sunshield might be a recommended facility which offers an affordable way to improve the safety of cyclists and e-bike riders at intersections. Limitations of the current sunshield design and current study are also discussed.},

  abstract = {To improve traffic operations and management under inclement weather, this work quantificationally investigated the influence of rainfall on the traffic flow characteristics of urban expressways in Beijing. Four basic traffic flow models (Greenshields model, Greenberg model, Underwood model, and Drake function model) were compared to determine the most suitable model for the detected data, which were collected by microwave detectors in the Beijing 2nd and 4thring expressway under normal or rainfall condition. Results showed that the Greenshields model was the best-fitted model. Under rainfall conditions, varying degrees of reductions were observed in the road capacity, free-flow speed, and speed at capacity. The findings also showed that the reductions of road capacity were 7.26\%, 10.87\%, and 17.09\%, and the reductions of free-flow speed were 3.07\%, 5.29\%, and 6.64\% under light rain, medium rain, and heavy rain, respectively. The reductions of speed at capacity revealed a similar tendency as that of the free-flow speed. Simultaneously, a new model that incorporated rainfall intensity is proposed on the basis of the Greenshields model and can achieve good performance. Overall, the results are beneficial for traffic managers in improving their decisions and predictions under rainfall weather.},
